    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>In the past weeks I enjoyed working on reversing a piece of software (don&rsquo;t ask me the name), to study how serial numbers are validated. The story the user has to follow is pretty common: download the trial, pay, get the serial number, use it in the annoying nag screen to get the fully functional version of the software.</p>

<p>Since my purpose is to not damage the company developing the software, I will not mention the name of the software, nor I will publish the final key generator in binary form, nor its source code. My goal is instead to study a real case of serial number validation, and to highlight its weaknesses.</p>

<p>In this post we are going to take a look at the steps I followed to reverse the serial validation process and to make a key generator using <a href="http://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> symbolic virtual machine. We are not going to follow all the details on the reversing part, since you cannot reproduce them on your own. We will concentrate our thoughts on the key-generator itself: that is the most interesting part.</p>

<h2>Getting acquainted</h2>

<p>The software is an <code>x86</code> executable, with no anti-debugging, nor anti-reversing techniques. When started it presents a nag screen asking for a registration composed by: customer number, serial number and a mail address. This is fairly common in software.</p>

<h2>Tools of the trade</h2>

<p>First steps in the reversing are devoted to find all the interesting functions to analyze. To do this I used <a href="https://www.hex-rays.com/products/ida/">IDA Pro</a> with Hex-Rays decompiler, and the <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff551063%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">WinDbg</a> debugger. For the last part I used <a href="http://klee.github.io/">KLEE</a> symbolic virtual machine under Linux, <a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">gcc compiler</a> and some bash scripting. The actual key generator was a simple <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms754130%28v=vs.100%29.aspx">WPF</a> application.</p>

<p>Let me skip the first part, since it is not very interesting. You can find many other articles on the web that can guide you through basic reversing techniques with IDA Pro. I only kept in mind some simple rules, while going forward:</p>

<ul>
<li>always rename functions that uses interesting data, even if you don&rsquo;t know precisely what they do. A name like <code>license_validation_unknown_8</code> is always better than a default like <code>sub_46fa39</code>;</li>
<li>similarly, rename data whenever you find it interesting;</li>
<li>change data types when you are sure they are wrong: use structs and arrays in case of aggregates;</li>
<li>follow cross references of data and functions to expand your collection;</li>
<li>validate your beliefs with the debugger if possible. For example, if you think a variable contains the serial, break with the debugger and see if it is the case.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Big picture</h2>

<p>When I collected the most interesting functions, I tried to understand the high level flow and the simpler functions. Here are the main variables and types used in the validation process. As a note for the reader: most of them have been purged of uninteresting details, for the sake of simplicity.</p>

<p>```c
enum {</p>

<pre><code>ERROR,
STANDARD,
PRO
</code></pre>

<p>} license_type = ERROR;
```
Here we have a global variable providing the type of the license, used to enable and disable features of the application.</p>

<p>```c
enum result_t {</p>

<pre><code>INVALID,
VALID,
VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION
</code></pre>

<p>};
<code>``
This is a convenient</code>enum<code>used as a result for the validation.</code>INVALID<code>and</code>VALID<code>values are pretty self-explanatory. </code>VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION` tells that this registration is valid only if the current software version is the last available. The reasons for this strange possibility will be clear shortly.</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>define HEADER_SIZE 8192</h1>

<p>struct {</p>

<pre><code>int header[HEADER_SIZE];
int data[1000000];
</code></pre>

<p>} mail_digest_table;
<code>``
This is a data structure, containing digests of mail addresses of known registered users. This is a pretty big file embedded in the executable itself. During startup, a resource is extracted in a temporary file and its content copied into this struct. Each element of the</code>header<code>vector is an offset pointing inside the</code>data` vector.</p>

<p>Here we have a pseudo-C code for the registration check, that uses data types and variables explained above:
```c
enum result_t check_registration(int serial, int customer_num, const char* mail) {</p>

<pre><code>// validate serial number
license_type = get_license_type(serial);
if (license_type == ERROR)
    return INVALID;

// validate customer number
int expected_customer = compute_customer_number(serial, mail);
if (expected_customer != customer_num)
    return INVALID;

// validate w.r.t. known registrations
int index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
if (index &gt; HEADER_SIZE)
    return VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION;
int mail_digest = compute_mail_digest(mail);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    if (mail_digest_table[index + i] == mail_digest)
        return VALID;
}
return INVALID;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The validation is divided in three main parts:</p>

<ul>
<li>serial number must be valid by itself;</li>
<li>serial number, combined with mail address has to correspond to the actual customer number;</li>
<li>there has to be a correspondence between serial number and mail address, stored in a static table in the binary.</li>
</ul>


<p>The last point is a little bit unusual. Let me restate it in this way: whenever a customer buys the software, the customer table gets updated with its data and become available in the <em>next</em> version of the software (because it is embedded in the binary and not downloaded trough the internet). This explains the <code>VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION</code> check: if you buy the software today, the current version does not contain your data. You are still allowed to get a &ldquo;pro&rdquo; version until a new version is released. In that moment you are forced to update to that new version, so the software can verify your registration with the updated table. Here is a pseudo-code of that check:</p>

<p>```c
switch (check_registration(serial, customer, mail)) {
case VALID:</p>

<pre><code>// the registration is OK! activate functionalities
activate_pro_functionality();
break;
</code></pre>

<p>case VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION:</p>

<pre><code>{
    // check if the current version is the last, by
    // using the internet.
    int current_version = get_current_version();
    int last_version = get_last_version();
    if (current_version == last_version)
        // OK for now: a new version is not available
        activate_pro_functionality();
    else
        // else, force the user to download the new version
        // before proceed
        ask_download();
}
break;
</code></pre>

<p>case INVALID:</p>

<pre><code>// registration is not valid
handle_invalid_registration();
break;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The version check is done by making an HTTP request to a specific page that returns a page having only the last version number of the software. Don&rsquo;t ask me why the protection is not completely server side but involves static tables, version checks and things like that. I don&rsquo;t know!</p>

<p>Anyway, this is the big picture of the registration validation functions, and this is pretty boring. Let&rsquo;s move on to the interesting part. You may notice that I provided code for the main procedure, but not for the helper functions like <code>get_license_type</code>, <code>compute_customer_number</code>, and so on. This is because I did not have to reverse them. They contain a lot of arithmetical and logical operations on registration data, and they are very difficult to understand. The good news is that we do not have to understand them, we need only to reverse them!</p>

<h2>Symbolic execution</h2>

<p>Symbolic execution is a way to execute programs using symbolic variables instead of concrete values. A symbolic variable is used whenever a value can be controlled by user input (this can be done by hand or determined by using taint analysis), and could be a file, standard input, a network stream, etc. Symbolic execution translates the program&rsquo;s semantics into a logical formula. Each instruction cause that formula to be updated. By solving a formula for one path, we get concrete values for the variables. If those values are used in the program, the execution reaches that program point. Dynamic Symbolic Execution (DSE) builds the logical formula at runtime, step-by-step, following one path at a time. When a branch of the program is found during the execution, the engine transforms the condition into arithmetic operations. It then chooses the T (true) or F (false) branch and updates the formula with this new constraint (or its negation). At the end of a path, the engine can backtrack and select another path to execute. For example:</p>

<p>```c
int v1 = SymVar_1, v2 = SymVar_2; // symbolic variables
if (v1 > 0)</p>

<pre><code>v2 = 0;
</code></pre>

<p>if (v2 == 0 &amp;&amp; v1 &lt;= 0)
   error();
```</p>

<p>We want to check if <code>error</code> is reachable, by using symbolic variables <code>SymVar_1</code> and <code>SymVar_2</code>, assigned to the program&rsquo;s variables <code>v1</code> and <code>v2</code>. In line 2 we have the condition <code>v1 &gt; 0</code> and so, the symbolic engine adds a constraint <code>SymVar_1 &gt; 0</code> for the <em>true branch</em> or conversely <code>SymVar_1 &lt;= 0</code> for the <em>false branch</em>. It then continues the execution trying with the first constraint. Whenever a new path condition is reached, new constraints are added to the symbolic state, until that condition is no more satisfiable. In that case, the engine backtracks and replaces some constraints with their negation, in order to reach other code paths. The execution engine tries to cover all code paths, by solving those constraints and their negations. For each portion of the code reached, the symbolic engine outputs a test case covering that part of the program, providing concrete values for the input variables. In the particular example given, the engine continues the execution, and finds the condition <code>v2 == 0 &amp;&amp; v1 &lt;= 0</code> at line 4. The path formula becomes so: <code>SymVar_1 &gt; 0 &amp;&amp; (SymVar_2 == 0 &amp;&amp; SymVar_1 &lt;= 0)</code>, that is not satisfiable. The symbolic engine provides then values for the variables that satisfies the previous formula (<code>SymVar_1 &gt; 0</code>). For example <code>SymVar_1 = 1</code> and some random value for <code>SymVar_2</code>. The engine then backtrack to the previous branch and uses the negation of the constraint, that is <code>SymVar_1 &lt;= 0</code>. It then adds the negation of the current constraint to cover the false branch, obtaining <code>SymVar_1 &lt;= 0 &amp;&amp; (SymVar_2 != 0 || SymVar_1 &gt; 0)</code>. This is satisfiable with <code>SymVar_1 = -1</code> and <code>SymVar_2 = 0</code>. This concludes the analysis of the program paths, and our symbolic execution engine can output the following test cases:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>v1 = 1</code>;</li>
<li><code>v1 = -1</code>, <code>v2 = 0</code>.</li>
</ul>


<p>Those test cases are enough to cover all the paths of the program.</p>

<p>This approach is useful for testing because it helps generating test cases. It is often effective, and it does not waste computational power of your brain. You know&hellip; tests are very difficult to do effectively, and brain power is such a scarce resource!</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t want to elaborate too much on this topic because it is way too big to fit in this post. Moreover, we are not going to use symbolic execution engines for testing purpose. This is just because we don&rsquo;t like to use things in the way they are intended :)</p>

<p>However, I will point you to some good references in the last section. Here I can list a series of common strengths and weaknesses of symbolic execution, just to give you a little bit of background:</p>

<p>Strengths:</p>

<ul>
<li>when a test case fails, the program is proven to be incorrect;</li>
<li>automatic test cases catch errors that often are overlooked in manual written test cases (this is from <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~cristic/papers/klee-osdi-08.pdf">KLEE paper</a>);</li>
<li>when it works it&rsquo;s cool :) (and this is from <a href="https://twitter.com/__x86">Jérémy</a>);</li>
</ul>


<p>Weaknesses:</p>

<ul>
<li>when no tests fail we are not sure everything is correct, because no proof of correctness is given; static analysis can do that when it works (and often it does not!);</li>
<li>covering all the paths is not enough, because a variable can hold different values in one path and only some of them cause a bug;</li>
<li>complete coverage for non trivial programs is often impossible, due to path explosion or constraint solver timeout;</li>
<li>scaling is difficult, and execution time of the engine can suffer;</li>
<li>undefined behavior of CPU could lead to unexpected results;</li>
<li>&hellip; and maybe there are a lot more remarks to add.</li>
</ul>


<h1>KLEE</h1>

<p>KLEE is a great example of a symbolic execution engine. It operates on <a href="http://llvm.org/">LLVM</a> byte code, and it is used for software verification purposes. KLEE is capable to automatically generate test cases achieving high code coverage. KLEE is also able to find memory errors such as out of bound array accesses and many other common errors. To do that, it needs an LLVM byte code version of the program, symbolic variables and (optionally) assertions. I have also prepared a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/mbrt/klee/">Docker image</a> with <code>clang</code> and <code>klee</code> already configured and ready to use. So, you have no excuses to not try it out! Take this example function:</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>define FALSE 0</h1>

<h1>define TRUE 1</h1>

<p>typedef int BOOL;</p>

<p>BOOL check_arg(int a) {</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; 10)
    return FALSE;
else if (a &lt;= 10)
    return TRUE;
return FALSE; // not reachable
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This is actually a silly example, I know, but let&rsquo;s pretend to verify this function with this main:</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>include &lt;assert.h></h1>

<h1>include &lt;klee/klee.h></h1>

<p>int main() {</p>

<pre><code>int input;
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;input, sizeof(int), "input");
return check_arg(input);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>In <code>main</code> we have a symbolic variable used as input for the function to be tested. We can also modify it to include an assertion:</p>

<p>```c
BOOL check_arg(int a) {</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; 10)
    return FALSE;
else if (a &lt;= 10)
    return TRUE;
klee_assert(FALSE);
return FALSE; // not reachable
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We can now use <code>clang</code> to compile the program to the LLVM byte code and run the test generation with the <code>klee</code> command:</p>

<p><code>
clang -emit-llvm -g -o test.ll -c test.c
klee test.ll
</code></p>

<p>We get this output:</p>

<p>```
KLEE: output directory is &ldquo;/work/klee-out-0&rdquo;</p>

<p>KLEE: done: total instructions = 26
KLEE: done: completed paths = 2
KLEE: done: generated tests = 2
```</p>

<p>KLEE will generate test cases for the <code>input</code> variable, trying to cover all the possible execution paths and to make the provided assertions to fail (if any given). In this case we have two execution paths and two generated test cases, covering them. Test cases are in the output directory (in this case <code>/work/klee-out-0</code>). The soft link <code>klee-last</code> is also provided for convenience, pointing to the last output directory. Inside that directory a bunch of files were created, including the two test cases named <code>test000001.ktest</code> and <code>test000002.ktest</code>. These are binary files, which can be examined with the <code>ktest-tool</code> utility. Let&rsquo;s try it:</p>

<p><code>
$ ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000001.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000001.ktest'
args       : ['test.ll']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: 'input'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 2147483647
</code></p>

<p>And the second one:</p>

<p><code>
$ ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000002.ktest
...
object    0: data: 0
</code></p>

<p>In these test files, KLEE reports the command line arguments, the symbolic objects along with their size and the value provided for the test. To cover the whole program, we need <code>input</code> variable to get a value greater than 10 and one below or equal. You can see that this is the case: in the first test case the value 2147483647 is used, covering the first branch, while 0 is provided for the second, covering the other branch.</p>

<p>So far, so good. But what if we change the function in this way?</p>

<p>```c
BOOL check_arg(int a) {</p>

<pre><code>if (a &gt; 10)
    return FALSE;
else if (a &lt; 10)    // instead of &lt;=
    return TRUE;
klee_assert(FALSE);
return FALSE;       // now reachable
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We get this output:</p>

<p>```
$ klee test.ll
KLEE: output directory is &ldquo;/work/klee-out-2&rdquo;
KLEE: ERROR: /work/test.c:9: ASSERTION FAIL: 0
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location</p>

<p>KLEE: done: total instructions = 27
KLEE: done: completed paths = 3
KLEE: done: generated tests = 3
```</p>

<p>And this is the <code>klee-last</code> directory contents:</p>

<p><code>
$ ls klee-last/
assembly.ll   run.istats        test000002.assert.err  test000003.ktest
info          run.stats         test000002.ktest       warnings.txt
messages.txt  test000001.ktest  test000002.pc
</code></p>

<p>Note the <code>test000002.assert.err</code> file. If we examine its corresponding test file, we have:</p>

<p><code>
$ ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000002.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000002.ktest'
...
object    0: data: 10
</code></p>

<p>As we had expected, the assertion fails when <code>input</code> value is 10. So, as we now have three execution paths, we also have three test cases, and the whole program gets covered. KLEE provides also the possibility to replay the tests with the real program, but we are not interested in it now. You can see a usage example in this <a href="http://klee.github.io/tutorials/testing-function/#replaying-a-test-case">KLEE tutorial</a>.</p>

<p>KLEE&rsquo;s abilities to find execution paths of an application are very good. According to the <a href="http://llvm.org/pubs/2008-12-OSDI-KLEE.html">OSDI 2008 paper</a>, KLEE has been successfully used to test all 89 stand-alone programs in GNU COREUTILS and the equivalent busybox port, finding previously undiscovered bugs, errors and inconsistencies. The achieved code coverage were more than 90% per tool. Pretty awesome!</p>

<p>But, you may ask: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_T9YtA1mRQ">The question is, who cares?</a>. You will see it in a moment.</p>

<h2>KLEE to reverse a function</h2>

<p>As we have a powerful tool to find execution paths, we can use it to find the path we are interested in. As showed by the nice <a href="https://feliam.wordpress.com/2010/10/07/the-symbolic-maze/">symbolic maze</a> post of Feliam, we can use KLEE to solve a maze. The idea is simple but very powerful: flag the portion of code you interested in with a <code>klee_assert(0)</code> call, causing KLEE to highlight the test case able to reach that point. In the maze example, this is as simple as changing a <code>read</code> call with a <code>klee_make_symbolic</code> and the <code>prinft("You win!\n")</code> with the already mentioned <code>klee_assert(0)</code>. Test cases triggering this assertion are the one solving the maze!</p>

<p>For a concrete example, let&rsquo;s suppose we have this function:</p>

<p>```c
int magic_computation(int input) {</p>

<pre><code>for (int i = 0; i &lt; 32; ++i)
    input ^= 1 &lt;&lt; i;
return input;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And we want to know for what input we get the output 253. A main that tests this could be:</p>

<p>```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int input = atoi(argv[1]);
int output = magic_computation(input);
if (output == 253)
    printf("You win!\n");
else
    printf("You lose\n");
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>KLEE can resolve this problem for us, if we provide symbolic inputs and actually an assert to trigger:</p>

<p>```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int input, result;
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;input, sizeof(int), "input");
result = magic_computation(input);
if (result == 253)
    klee_assert(0);
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Run KLEE and print the result:</p>

<p><code>
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o magic.ll -c magic.c
$ klee magic.ll
$ ktest-tool --write-ints klee-last/test000001.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000001.ktest'
args       : ['magic.ll']
num objects: 1
object    0: name: 'input'
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: -254
</code></p>

<p>The answer is -254. Let&rsquo;s test it:</p>

<p><code>
$ gcc magic.c
$ ./a.out -254
You win!
</code></p>

<p>Yes!</p>

<h2>KLEE, libc and command line arguments</h2>

<p>Not all the functions are so simple. At least we could have calls to the C standard library such as <code>strlen</code>, <code>atoi</code>, and such. We cannot link our test code with the system available C library, as it is not inspectable by KLEE. For example:</p>

<p>```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int input = atoi(argv[1]);
return input;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>If we run it with KLEE we get this error:</p>

<p><code>
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o atoi.ll -c atoi.c
$ klee atoi.ll
KLEE: output directory is "/work/klee-out-4"
KLEE: WARNING: undefined reference to function: atoi
KLEE: WARNING ONCE: calling external: atoi(0)
KLEE: ERROR: /work/atoi.c:5: failed external call: atoi
KLEE: NOTE: now ignoring this error at this location
...
</code></p>

<p>To fix this we can use the KLEE uClibc and POSIX runtime. Taken from the help:</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;If we were running a normal native application, it would have been linked with the C library, but in this case KLEE is running the LLVM bitcode file directly. In order for KLEE to work effectively, it needs to have definitions for all the external functions the program may call. Similarly, a native application would be running on top of an operating system that provides lower level facilities like write(), which the C library uses in its implementation. As before, KLEE needs definitions for these functions in order to fully understand the program. We provide a POSIX runtime which is designed to work with KLEE and the uClibc library to provide the majority of operating system facilities used by command line applications&rdquo;</em>.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s try to use these facilities to test our <code>atoi</code> function:</p>

<p>```
$ klee &mdash;optimize &mdash;libc=uclibc &mdash;posix-runtime atoi.ll &mdash;sym-args 0 1 3
KLEE: NOTE: Using klee-uclibc : /usr/local/lib/klee/runtime/klee-uclibc.bca

<p>KLEE: done: total instructions = 5756

```</p>

<p>And KLEE founds the possible out of bound access in our program. Because you know, our program is bugged :) Before to jump and fix our code, let me briefly explain what these new flags did:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>--optimize</code>: this is for dead code elimination. It is actually a good idea to use this flag when working with non-trivial applications, since it speeds things up;</li>
<li><code>--libc=uclibc</code> and <code>--posix-runtime</code>: these are the aforementioned options for uClibc and POSIX runtime;</li>
<li><code>--sym-args 0 1 3</code>: this flag tells KLEE to run the program with minimum 0 and maximum 1 argument of length 3, and make the arguments symbolic.</li>
</ul>


<p>Note that adding <code>atoi</code> function to our code, adds 68 execution paths to the program. Using many libc functions in our code adds complexity, so we have to use them carefully when we want to reverse complex functions.</p>

<p>Let now make the program safe by adding a check to the command line argument length. Let&rsquo;s also add an assertion, because it is fun :)</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>include &lt;stdlib.h></h1>

<h1>include &lt;assert.h></h1>

<h1>include &lt;klee/klee.h></h1>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int result = argc &gt; 1 ? atoi(argv[1]) : 0;
if (result == 42)
    klee_assert(0);
return result;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We could also have written <code>klee_assert(result != 42)</code>, and get the same result. No matter what solution we adopt, now we have to run KLEE as before:</p>

<p>```
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o atoi2.ll -c atoi2.c
$ klee &mdash;optimize &mdash;libc=uclibc &mdash;posix-runtime atoi2.ll &mdash;sym-args 0 1 3
KLEE: NOTE: Using klee-uclibc : /usr/local/lib/klee/runtime/klee-uclibc.bca

<p>KLEE: done: total instructions = 5962
KLEE: done: completed paths = 73
KLEE: done: generated tests = 69
```</p>

<p>Here we go! We have fixed our bug. KLEE is also able to find an input to make the assertion fail:</p>

<p><code>
$ ls klee-last/ | grep err
test000016.assert.err
$ ktest-tool klee-last/test000016.ktest
ktest file : 'klee-last/test000016.ktest'
args       : ['atoi.ll', '--sym-args', '0', '1', '3']

...
object    1: name: 'arg0'
object    1: size: 4
object    1: data: '+42\x00'
...
</code></p>

<p>And the answer is the string &ldquo;+42&rdquo;&hellip; as we know.</p>

<p>There are many other KLEE options and functionalities, but let&rsquo;s move on and try to solve our original problem. Interested readers can find a good tutorial, for example, in <a href="http://klee.github.io/tutorials/testing-coreutils/">How to Use KLEE to Test GNU Coreutils</a>.</p>

<h2>KLEE keygen</h2>

<p>Now that we know basic KLEE commands, we can try to apply them to our particular case. We have understood some of the validation algorithm, but we don&rsquo;t know the computation details. They are just a mess of arithmetical and logical operations that we are tired to analyze.</p>

<p>Here is our plan:</p>

<ul>
<li>we need at least a valid customer number, a serial number and a mail address;</li>
<li>more ambitiously we want a list of them, to make a key generator.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is a possibility:</p>

<p>```c
// copy and paste of all the registration code
enum {</p>

<pre><code>ERROR,
STANDARD,
PRO
</code></pre>

<p>} license_type = ERROR;
// &hellip;
enum result_t check_registration(int serial, int customer_num, const char* mail);
// &hellip;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int serial, customer;
char mail[10];
enum result_t result;
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;serial, sizeof(serial), "serial");
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;customer, sizeof(customer), "customer");
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;mail, sizeof(mail), "mail");

valid = check_registration(serial, customer, mail);
valid &amp;= license_type == PRO;
klee_assert(!valid);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Super simple. Copy and paste everything, make the inputs symbolic and assert a certain result (negated, of course).</p>

<p>No! That&rsquo;s not so simple. This is actually the most difficult part of the game. First of all, what do we want to copy? We don&rsquo;t have the source code. In my case I used Hex-Rays decompiler, so maybe I have cheated. When you decompile, however, you don&rsquo;t get immediately a compilable C source code, since there could be dependencies between functions, global variables, and specific Hex-Rays types. For this latter problem I&rsquo;ve prepared a <a href="https://github.com/mbrt/keygen-post/blob/master/src/ida_defs.h"><code>ida_defs.h</code></a> header, providing defines coming from IDA and from Windows headers.</p>

<p>But what to copy? The high level picture of the validation algorithm I have presented is an ideal one. The <code>check_registration</code> function is actually a big set of auxiliary functions and data, very tightened with other parts of the program. Even if we now know the most interesting functions, we need to know how much of the related code, is useful or not. We cannot throw everything in our key generator, since every function brings itself other related data and functions. In this way we will end up having the whole program in it. We need to minimize the code KLEE has to analyze, otherwise it will be too difficult to have its job done.</p>

<p>This is a picture of the high level workflow, as IDA proximity view proposes:</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrt/keygen-post/master/known_license_func_diagram.png" alt="Known license functions" /></p>

<p>and this is the overview for a single node of this schema (precisely <code>license_getType</code>):</p>

<p><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mbrt/keygen-post/master/get_license_type_overview.png" alt="license_getType overview" /></p>

<p>As you can imagine, the complete call graph becomes really big in the end.</p>

<p>In the cleanup process I have done, a big bunch of functions removed is the one extracting and loading the table of valid mail addresses. To do this I stepped with the debugger until the table was completely loaded and then dumped the memory of the process. Then I&rsquo;ve used a nice &ldquo;export to C array&rdquo; functionality of <a href="http://www.hexworkshop.com/">HEX Workshop</a>, to export the actual piece of memory of the mail table to actual code:</p>

<p>```c
uint16_t hashHeader[8192] =
{</p>

<pre><code>0x0, 0x28, 0x12, 0x24, 0x2d, 0x2b, 0x2e, 0x23, 0x2b, 0x26,
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>};
int16_t hashData[1000000] =
{</p>

<pre><code>15306, 18899, 18957, -24162, 63045, -26834, -21, -39653, 271441, -5588,
// ...
</code></pre>

<p>};
```</p>

<p>But, cutting out code is not the only problem I&rsquo;ve found in this step. External constraints must be carefully considered. For example the <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/time/">time</a> function can be handled by KLEE itself. KLEE tries to generate useful values even from that function. This is good if we want to test bugs related to a strange current time, but in our case, since the code will be executed by the program <em>at a particular time</em>, we are only interested in the value provided at that time. We don&rsquo;t want KLEE traits this function as symbolic; we only want the right time value. To solve that problem, I have replaced all the calls to <code>time</code> to a <code>my_time</code> function, returning a fixed value, defined in the source code.</p>

<p>Another problem comes from the extraction of the functions from their outer context. Often code is written with <em>implicit conventions</em> in mind. These are not self-evident in the code because checks are avoided. A trivial example is the null terminator and valid ASCII characters in strings. KLEE does not assume those constraints, but the validation code does. This is because the GUI provides only valid strings. A less trivial example is that the mail address is always passed lowercase from the GUI to the lower level application logic. This is not self-evident if you do not follow every step from the user input to the actual computations with the data.</p>

<p>The solution to this latter problem is to provide those constraints to KLEE:</p>

<p>```c
char mail[10];
char c;
klee_make_symbolic(mail, sizeof(mail), &ldquo;mail&rdquo;);
for (i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(mail) &ndash; 1; ++i) {</p>

<pre><code>c = mail[i];
klee_assume( (c &gt;= '0' &amp; c &lt;= '9') | (c &gt;= 'a' &amp; c &lt;= 'z') | c == '\0' );
</code></pre>

<p>}
klee_assume(mail[sizeof(mail) &ndash; 1] == &lsquo;\0&rsquo;);
```</p>

<p>Logical operators inside <code>klee_assume</code> function are bitwise and not logical (i.e. <code>&amp;</code> and <code>|</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code> and <code>||</code>) because they are simpler, since they do not add the extra branches required by lazy operators.</p>

<h2>Throw everything into KLEE</h2>

<p>Having extracted all the needed functions and global data and solved all the issues with the code, we can now move on and run KLEE with our brand new test program:</p>

<p><code>
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o attempt1.ll -c attempt1.c
$ klee --optimize --libc=uclibc --posix-runtime attempt1.ll
</code></p>

<p>And then wait for an answer.</p>

<p>And wait for another while.</p>

<p>Make some coffee, drink it, come back and watch the PC heating up.</p>

<p>Go out, walk around, come back, have a shower, and&hellip;. oh no! It&rsquo;s still running! OK, that&rsquo;s enough! Let&rsquo;s kill it.</p>

<h2>Deconstruction approach</h2>

<p>We have assumed too much from the tool. It&rsquo;s time to use the brain and ease its work a little bit.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s decompose the big picture of the registration check presented before piece by piece. We will try to solve it bit by bit, to reduce the solution space and so, the complexity.</p>

<p>Recall that the algorithm is composed by three main conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>serial number must be valid by itself;</li>
<li>serial number, combined with mail address have to correspond to the actual customer number;</li>
<li>there has to be a correspondence between serial number and mail address, stored in a static table in the binary.</li>
</ul>


<p>Can we split them in different KLEE runs?</p>

<p>Clearly the first one can be written as:</p>

<p>```c</p>

<h1>include &lt;assert.h></h1>

<h1>include &lt;klee/klee.h></h1>

<p>// include all the functions extracted from the program</p>

<h1>include &ldquo;extracted_code.c&rdquo;</h1>

<p>enum {</p>

<pre><code>ERROR,
STANDARD,
PRO
</code></pre>

<p>} license_type = ERROR;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int serial, valid;
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;serial, sizeof(serial), "serial");
license_type = get_license_type(serial);
valid = (license_type == PRO);
klee_assert(!valid);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And let&rsquo;s see if KLEE can work with this single function:</p>

<p>```
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o serial_type.ll -c serial_type.c
$ klee &mdash;optimize &mdash;libc=uclibc &mdash;posix-runtime serial_type.ll
&hellip;
KLEE: ERROR: /work/symbolic/serial_type.c:17: ASSERTION FAIL: !valid
&hellip;</p>

<p>$ ls klee-last/ | grep err
test000019.assert.err
$ ktest-tool &mdash;write-ints klee-last/test000019.ktest
ktest file : &lsquo;klee-last/test000019.ktest&rsquo;
args       : [&lsquo;serial_type.ll&rsquo;]
num objects: 2
object    0: name: &lsquo;model_version&rsquo;
object    0: size: 4
object    0: data: 1
object    1: name: &lsquo;serial&rsquo;
object    1: size: 4
object    1: data: 102690141
```</p>

<p>Yes! we now have a serial number that is considered PRO by our target application.</p>

<p>The third condition is less simple: we have a table in which are stored values matching mail addresses with serial numbers. The high level check is this:</p>

<p>```c
int check(int serial, char* mail) {</p>

<pre><code>int index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
if (index &gt; HEADER_SIZE)
    return VALID_IF_LAST_VERSION;
int mail_digest = compute_mail_digest(mail);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    if (mail_digest_table[index + i] == mail_digest)
        return VALID;
}
return INVALID;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>This piece of code imposes constraints on our mail address and serial number, but not on the customer number. We can rewrite the checks in two parts, the one checking the serial, and the one checking the mail address:</p>

<p>```c
int check_serial(int serial, char* mail) {</p>

<pre><code>int index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
int valid = index &lt;= HEADER_SIZE;
</code></pre>

<p>}</p>

<p>int check_mail(char* mail, int index) {</p>

<pre><code>int mail_digest = compute_mail_digest(mail);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; 3; ++i) {
    if (mail_digest_table[index + i] == mail_digest)
        return 1;
}
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>The <code>check_mail</code> function needs the index in the table as secondary input, so it is not completely independent from the other check function. However, <code>check_mail</code> can be incorporated by our successful test program used before:</p>

<p>```c
// &hellip;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int serial, valid, index;
klee_make_symbolic(&amp;serial, sizeof(serial), "serial");
license_type = get_license_type(serial);
valid = (license_type == PRO);
// added just now
index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
valid &amp;= index &lt;= HEADER_SIZE;

klee_assert(!valid);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>And if we run it, we get our revised serial number, that satisfies the additional constraint:</p>

<p>```
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o serial.ll -c serial.c
$ klee &mdash;optimize &mdash;libc=uclibc &mdash;posix-runtime serial.ll
&hellip;
KLEE: ERROR: /work/symbolic/serial.c:21: ASSERTION FAIL: !valid
&hellip;</p>

<p>$ ls klee-last/ | grep err
test000032.assert.err
$ ktest-tool &mdash;write-ints klee-last/test000019.ktest
&hellip;
object    1: name: &lsquo;serial&rsquo;
object    1: data: 120300641
&hellip;
```</p>

<p>For those who are wondering if <code>get_index_in_mail_table</code> could return a negative index, and so possibly crash the program I can answer that they are not alone. <a href="https://twitter.com/0vercl0k">@0vercl0k</a> asked me the same question, and unfortunately I have to answer a no. I tried, because I am a lazy ass, by changing the assertion above to <code>klee_assert(index &lt; 0)</code>, but it was not triggered by KLEE. I then manually checked the function&rsquo;s code and I saw a beautiful <code>if (result &lt; 0) result = 0</code>. So, the answer is no! You have not found a vulnerability in the application :(</p>

<p>For the <code>check_mail</code> solution we have to provide the index of a serial, but wait&hellip; we have it! We have now a serial, so, computing the index of the table is simple as executing this:</p>

<p><code>c
int index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
</code></p>

<p>Therefore, given a serial number, we can solve the mail address in this way:</p>

<p>```c
// &hellip;</p>

<p>int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int serial, valid, index;
char mail[10];

// mail is symbolic
klee_make_symbolic(mail, sizeof(mail), "mail");
for (i = 0; i &lt; sizeof(mail) - 1; ++i)
{
    c = mail[i];
    klee_assume( (c &gt;= '0' &amp; c &lt;= '9') | (c &gt;= 'a' &amp; c &lt;= 'z') | c == '\0' );
}
klee_assume(mail[sizeof(mail) - 1] == '\0');

// get serial as external input
if (argc &lt; 2)
    return 1;
serial = atoi(argv[1]);

// compute index
index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
// check validity
valid = check_mail(mail, index);
klee_assert(!valid);
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We only have to run KLEE with the additional serial argument, providing the computed one by the previous step.</p>

<p><code>
$ clang -emit-llvm -g -o mail.ll -c mail.c
$ klee --optimize --libc=uclibc --posix-runtime mail.ll 120300641
...
KLEE: ERROR: /work/symbolic/mail.c:34: ASSERTION FAIL: !valid
...
$ ls klee-last/ | grep err
test000023.assert.err
$ ktest-tool klee-last/test000023.ktest
...
object    1: name: 'mail'
object    1: data: 'yrwt\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00'
...
</code></p>

<p>OK, the mail found by KLEE is &ldquo;yrwt&rdquo;. This is not a mail, of course, but in the code there is not a proper validation imposing the presence of &lsquo;@&rsquo; and &lsquo;.&rsquo; chars, so we are fine with it :)</p>

<p>The last piece of the puzzle we need is the customer number. Here is the check:</p>

<p>```c
int expected_customer = compute_customer_number(serial, mail);
if (expected_customer != customer_num)</p>

<pre><code>return INVALID;
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>This is simpler than before, since we already have a serial and a mail, so the only thing missing is a customer number matching those. We can compute it directly, even without symbolic execution:</p>

<p>```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{</p>

<pre><code>if (argc &lt; 3)
    return 1;

int serial = atoi(argv[1]);
char* mail = argv[2];
int customer_number = compute_customer_number(serial, mail);
printf("%d\n", customer_number);
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s execute it:</p>

<p><code>
$ gcc customer.c customer
$ ./customer 120300641 yrwt
1175211979
</code></p>

<p>Yeah! And if we try those numbers and mail address onto the real program, we are now legit and registered users :)</p>

<h2>Want more keys?</h2>

<p>We have just found one key, and that&rsquo;s cool, but what about making a keygen? KLEE is deterministic, so if you run the same code over and over you will get always the same results. So, we are now stuck with this single serial.</p>

<p>To solve the problem we have to think about what variables we can move around to get different valid serial numbers to start with, and with them solve related mail addresses and compute a customer number.</p>

<p>We have to add constraints to the serial generation, so that every time we can run a slightly different version of the program and get a different serial number. The simplest thing to do is to constraint <code>get_index_in_mail_table</code> to return an index inside a proper subset of the range [0, <code>HEADER_SIZE</code>] used before. For example we can divide it in equal chunks of size 5 and run the whole thing for every chunk.</p>

<p>This is the modified version of the serial generation:</p>

<p>```c
int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {</p>

<pre><code>int serial, min_index, max_index, valid;

// get chunk bounds as external inputs
if (argc &lt; 3)
    return 1;
min_index= atoi(argv[1]);
max_index= atoi(argv[2]);

// check and assert
index = get_index_in_mail_table(serial);
valid = index &gt;= min_index &amp;&amp; index &lt; max_index;
klee_assert(!valid);
return 0;
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<p>We now need a script that runs KLEE and collect the results for all those chunks. Here it is:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<p>MIN_INDEX=0
MAX_INDEX=8033
STEP=5</p>

<p>echo &ldquo;Index;License;Mail;Customer&rdquo;</p>

<p>for INDEX in $(seq $MIN_INDEX $STEP $MAX_INDEX); do</p>

<pre><code>echo -n "$INDEX;"

CHUNK_MIN=$INDEX
CHUNK_MAX=$(( CHUNK_MIN + STEP ))
LICENSE=$(./solve.sh serial.ll $CHUNK_MIN $CHUNK_MAX)
if [ -z "$LICENSE" ]; then
    echo ";;"
    continue
fi
MAIL_ARRAY=$(./solve.sh mail.ll $LICENSE)
if [ -z "$MAIL_ARRAY" ]; then
    echo ";;"
    continue
fi
MAIL=$(sed 's/\\x00//g' &lt;&lt;&lt; $MAIL_ARRAY | sed "s/'//g")
CUSTOMER=$(./customer $LICENSE $MAIL)

echo "$LICENSE;$MAIL;$CUSTOMER"
</code></pre>

<p>done
```</p>

<p>This script uses the <code>solve.sh</code> script, that does the actual work and prints the result of KLEE runs:</p>

<p>```bash</p>

<h1>!/bin/bash</h1>

<h1>do work</h1>

<p>klee $@ >/dev/null 2>&amp;1</p>

<h1>print result</h1>

<p>ASSERT_FILE=$(ls klee-last | grep .assert.err)
TEST_FILE=$(basename klee-last/$ASSERT_FILE .assert.err)
OUTPUT=$(ktest-tool &mdash;write-ints klee-last/$TEST_FILE.ktest | grep data)
RESULT=$(sed &rsquo;s/.<em>:.</em>: //&lsquo; &lt;&lt;&lt; $OUTPUT)
echo $RESULT</p>

<h1>cleanup</h1>

<p>rm -rf $(readlink -f klee-last)
rm -f klee-last
```</p>

<p>Here is the final run:</p>

<p><code>
$ ./keygen_all.sh
Index;License;Mail;Customer
...
2400;;;
2405;115019227;4h79;1162863222
2410;112625605;7cxd;554797040
...
</code></p>

<p>Note that not all the serial numbers are solvable, but we are OK with that. We now have a bunch of solved registrations. We can put them in some simple GUI that exposes to the user one of them randomly.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all folks.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This was a brief journey into the magic world of reversing and symbolic execution. We started with the dream to make a key generator for a real world application, and we&rsquo;ve got a list of serial numbers to put in some nice GUI (maybe with some MIDI soundtrack playing in the background to make users crazy). But this was not our purpose. The path we followed is far more interesting than ruining programmer&rsquo;s life. So, just to recap, here are the main steps we followed to generate our serial numbers:</p>

<ol>
<li>reverse the skeleton of the serial number validation procedure, understanding data and the most important functions, using a debugger, IDA, and all the reversing tools we can access;</li>
<li>collect the functions and produce a C version of them (this could be quite difficult, unless you have access to HEX-Rays decompiler or similar tool);</li>
<li>mark some strategic variable as symbolic and mark some strategic code path with an assert;</li>
<li>ask KLEE to provide us the values for symbolic variables that make the assert to fail, and so to reach that code path;</li>
<li>since the last step provides us only a single serial number, add an external input to the symbolic program, using it as additional constraint, in order to get different values for symbolic variables reaching the assert.</li>
</ol>


<p>The last point can be seen as quite obscure, I can admit that, but the idea is simple. Since KLEE&rsquo;s goal is to reach a path with some values for the symbolic variables, it is not interested in exploring all the possibilities for those values. We can force this exploration manually, by adding an additional constraint, and varying a parameter from run to run, and get (hopefully) different correct values for our serial number.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>As last year, the French conference <a href="http://www.nosuchcon.org/#challenge">No Such Con</a> returns for its second edition in Paris from the 19th of November until the 21th of November. And again, the brilliant <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">Eloi Vanderbeken</a> &amp; his mates at <a href="http://synacktiv.fr/en/index.html">Synacktiv</a> put together a series of three security challenges especially for this occasion.
Apparently, the three tasks have already been <a href="https://twitter.com/Synacktiv/status/515174845844582401">solved</a> by awesome <a href="https://twitter.com/0xf4b">@0xfab</a> which won the competition, hats off :).</p>

<p>To be honest I couldn&rsquo;t resist to try at least the first step, as I know that <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">Eloi</a> always builds <a href="http://0vercl0k.tuxfamily.org/bl0g/?p=253">really twisted</a> and <a href="http://www.nosuchcon.org/2013/#challenge">nice binaries</a> ; so I figured I should just give it a go!</p>

<p>But this time we are trying something different though: this post has been co-authored by both <em>Emilien Girault</em> (<a href="https://twitter.com/emiliengirault">@emiliengirault</a>) and I. As we have slightly different solutions, we figured it would be a good idea to write those up inside a single post. This article starts with an introduction to the challenge and will then fork, presenting my solution and his.</p>

<p>As the article is quite long, here is the complete table of contents:</p>

<h1>REcon: Here be dragons</h1>

<p>This part is just here to get things started: how to have a debugging environment, to know a bit more about MIPS and to know a bit more what the binary is actually doing.</p>

<h2>MIPS 101</h2>

<p>The first interesting detail about this challenge is that it is a MIPS binary ; it&rsquo;s really kind of exotic for me. I&rsquo;m mainly looking at Intel assembly, so having the opportunity to look at an unknown architecture is always appealing. You know it&rsquo;s like discovering a new little toy, so I just couldn&rsquo;t help myself &amp; started to read the MIPS basics.</p>

<p>This part is going to describe only the essential information you need to both understand and crack wide open the binary ; and as I said I am not a MIPS expert, at all. From what I have seen though, this is fairly similar to what you can see on an Intel x86 CPU:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Little-endian">little endian</a> (note that it also exists a big-endian version but it won&rsquo;t be covered in this post),</li>
<li>It has way more general purpose registers,</li>
<li>The calling convention is similar to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/fr-fr/library/6xa169sk.aspx">__fastcall</a>: you pass arguments via registers, and get the return of the function in <em>$v0</em>,</li>
<li>Unlike <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86">x86</a>, MIPS is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reduced_instruction_set_computing">RISC</a>, so much simpler to take in hand (trust me on that one),</li>
<li>Of course, there is an IDA processor,</li>
<li>Linux and the regular tools also exists for MIPS so we will be able to use the &ldquo;normal&rdquo; tools we are used to use,</li>
<li>It also uses a stack, much less than x86 though as most of the things happening are in registers (in the challenge at least).</li>
</ul>


<h2>Setting up a proper debugging environment</h2>

<p>The answer to that question is <a href="http://wiki.qemu.org/Main_Page">Qemu</a>, as expected. You can even download already fully prepared &amp; working Debian images on <a href="https://people.debian.org/~aurel32/qemu/mipsel/">aurel32</a>&rsquo;s website.</p>

</code></p>

<p>Brilliant :&ndash;).</p>

<h2>The big picture</h2>

<p>Now that we have a way of both launching and debugging the challenge, we can open the binary in IDA and start to understand what type of protection scheme is used. As always at that point, we are really not interested in details: we just want to understand how
it works and what parts we will have to target to get the <em>good boy</em> message.</p>

<p>After a bit of time in IDA, here is how works the binary:</p>

<ol>
<li> It checks that the user supplied one argument: the serial</li>
<li> It checks that the supplied serial is 48 characters long</li>
<li> It converts the string into 6 <em>DWORD</em>s (/!\ pitfall warning: the conversion is a bit strange, be sure to verify your algorithm)</li>
<li> The beast forks in two:

<ol>
<li>[Father] It seems, somehow, this one is <em>driving</em> the son, more on that later</li>
<li>[Son] After executing a big chunk of code that modifies (in place) the 6 original <em>DWORD</em>s, they get compared against the following string <em>[ Synacktiv + NSC = &lt;3 ]</em></li>
<li>[Son] If the comparison succeeds you win, else you loose</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>


<p>Basically, we need to find the 6 input <em>DWORD</em>s that are going to generate the following ones in <em>output</em>: <em>0x7953205b</em>, <em>0x6b63616e</em>, <em>0x20766974</em>, <em>0x534e202b</em>, <em>0x203d2043</em>, <em>0x5d20333c</em>. We also know that the father is going to interact with its son, so we need to study both codes to be sure to understand the challenge properly.
If you prefer code, here is the big picture in C:</p>

<p>```c big picture
int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{</p>

<pre><code>DWORD serial_dwords[6] = {0};
if(argc != 2)
    Usage();

// Conversion
a2i(argv[1], serial_dwords);

pid_t pid = fork();
if(pid != 0)
{
    // Father
    // a lot of stuff going on here, we will see that later on
}
else
{
    // Son
    // a lot of stuff going on here, we will see that later on

    char *clear = (char*)serial_dwords;
    bool win = memcmp(clear, "[ Synacktiv + NSC = &lt;3 ]", 48);
    if(win)
        GoodBoy();
    else
        BadBoy();
}
</code></pre>

<p>}
```</p>

<h1>Let&rsquo;s get our hands dirty</h1>

<h2>Father&rsquo;s in charge</h2>

<p>The first thing I did after having the big picture was to look at the code of the father. Why? The code seemed a bit simpler than the son&rsquo;s one, so I figured studying the father would make more sense to understand what kind of protection we need to subvert.
You can even crank up <a href="http://linux.die.net/man/1/strace">strace</a> to have a clearer overview of the syscalls used:</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s an interesting output that I didn&rsquo;t expect at all actually. What we are seeing here is the father driving its son by modifying, potentially (we will find out that later), its context every time the son is <em>SIGTRAP</em>ing (note <em>waitpid</em> second argument).</p>

<p>From here, if you are quite familiar with the different existing type of software protections (I&rsquo;m not saying I am an expert in this field but I just happened to know that one :-P) you can pretty much guess what that is: nanomites this is!</p>

<h3>Nanomites 101</h3>

<p>Namomites are quite a nice protection. Though, it is quite a generic name ; you can really use that protection scheme in whatever way you like: your imagination is the only limit here. To be honest, this was the first time I saw this kind of protection implemented on a Unix system ; really good surprise!
It usually works this way:</p>

<ol>
<li> You have two processes: a driver and a driven ; a father and a son</li>
<li> The driver is attaching itself to the driven one with the debug APIs available on the targeted platform (<em>ptrace</em> here, and <em>CreateProcess</em>/<em>DebugActiveProcess</em> on Windows)

<ol>
<li>Note that, by design you won&rsquo;t be able to attach yourself to the son as both Windows and Linux prevent that (by design): some people call that part the <em>DebugBlocker</em></li>
<li>You will able to debug the driver though</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>  Usually the interesting code is in the son, but again you can do whatever you want. Basically, you have two rules if you want an efficient protection:

<ol>
<li>Make sure the driven process can&rsquo;t run without its driver and that they are really tied to each other</li>
<li> The strength of the protection is that strong/intimate bound between the two processes</li>
<li>Design your algorithm such that <em>removing</em> the driver is really difficult/painful/driving mad the attacker</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li> The driven process can <em>call</em>/<em>notify</em> the driver by just <em>SIGTRAP</em>ing with an <em>int3</em>/<em>break</em> instruction for example</li>
</ol>


<p>As I said, I see this protection scheme more like a <em>recipe</em>: you are free to customize it at your convenience really. If you want to read more on the subject, here is a list of links you should check out:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/621236/Nanomite-and-Debug-Blocker-for-Linux-Applications">Nanomite and Debug Blocker for Linux Applications</a>: It gives a good overview of how you can get such a protection scheme to work on Linux,</li>
<li><a href="http://blog.w4kfu.com/post/Unpackme_I_am_Famous">Unpackme I am Famous</a>: This shows you what nanomites look like on Windows in a real protected product ; done by my mate <a href="https://twitter.com/w4kfu">@w4kfu</a>,</li>
<li><a href="http://w3challs.com/challenges/cracking">Debug me</a>: Another sweet challenge that uses nanomites on Windows</li>
</ul>


<h3><a id="static_analysis_father"></a> How the father works</h3>

<p>Now it is time to took into details the father ; here is how it works:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first thing it does is to <em>waitpid</em> until its son triggers a <em>SIGTRAP</em></li>
<li>The driver retrieves the CPU context of the son process and more precisely its <em>program counter</em>: <em>$pc</em></li>
<li>Then we have a huge block of arithmetic computations. But after spending a bit of time to study it, we can see that huge block as a black-box function that takes two parameters: the program counter of the son and some kind of counter value (as this code is going to be executed in a loop, for each <em>SIGTRAP</em> this variable is going to be incremented). It generates a single output which is a 32 bits value that I call the <em>first magic value</em>.
Let&rsquo;s not focus on what the block is actually doing though, we will develop some tool in the next part to deal with that :&ndash;) so let&rsquo;s keep moving!</li>
</ul>


<p><img class="center" src="/images/taming_a_wild_nanomite-protected_mips_binary_with_symbolic_execution_no_such_crackme/father_code.png"></p>

<ul>
<li>This <em>magic value</em> is then used to find a specific entry in an array of <em>QWORD</em>s (606 <em>QWORD</em>s which is 6 times the number of <em>break</em> instructions in the son &mdash; you will understand that a bit later don&rsquo;t worry). Basically, the code is going to loop over every single <em>QWORD</em> of this array until finding one that has the high <em>DWORD</em> equals to the <em>magic value</em>. From there you get another <em>magic value</em> which is the lowest <em>DWORD</em> of the matching <em>QWORD</em>.</li>
<li>Another huge block of arithmetic computations is used. Similarly to the first one, we can see it as a black-box function with two inputs: the second <em>magic value</em> and a round index (the son is executing its code 6 times, so this round index will start from 0 until 5 &mdash; again this will be a bit clearer when we look at the son, so just keep this detail in your mind). The output of this function is a 32 bits value. Again, do not study this block, we don&rsquo;t need it.</li>
<li>The generated value is in fact a valid code address inside the son ; so straight after the computation, the father is going to modify the program counter in the previously retrieved CPU context. Once this is done, it calls <em>ptrace</em> with <em>SETREGS</em> to set the new CPU context of the son.</li>
</ul>


<p>This is what roughly is going to be executed every time the son is going to hit a <em>break</em> instruction ; the father is definitely driving the son. And we can feel it now, the son is going to jump (via its father) through block of codes that aren&rsquo;t (necessary) contiguous in memory, so studying the son code as it is in IDA is quite pointless as those basic blocks aren&rsquo;t going to be executed in this order.</p>

<p>Long story short, the nanomites are used as some kind of runtime code flow scrambling primitive, isn&rsquo;t it exciting? Told you that <a href="https://twitter.com/elvanderb">@elvanderb</a> is crazy :&ndash;).</p>

<h2>Gearing up: Writing a symbolic executing engine <a id="writing_symbolic_exec"></a></h2>

<p>At that point, I can assure you that we need some tooling: we have studied the binary, we know how the main parts work and we just need to extract the different equations/formulas used by both the computation of the son&rsquo;s program counter and the serial verification algorithm. Basically the engine is going to be useful to study both the father and the son.</p>

<p>If you are not really familiar with symbolic execution, I recommend you take a little bit of time to read <a href="https://doar-e.github.io/blog/2013/09/16/breaking-kryptonites-obfuscation-with-symbolic-execution/">Breaking Kryptonite&rsquo;s Obfuscation: A Static Analysis Approach Relying on Symbolic Execution</a> and check out <a href="https://github.com/0vercl0k/z3-playground">z3-playground</a> if you are not really familiar with <a href="https://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> and its Python bindings.</p>

<p>This time I decided to not build that engine as an IDA Python script, but just to do everything myself. Do not be afraid though, even if it sounds scary it is really not: the challenge is a perfect environment for those kind of things. It doesn&rsquo;t use a lot of instructions, we don&rsquo;t need to support branches and nearly only arithmetic instructions are used.</p>

<p>I also chose to implement this engine in a way that we can also use it as a simple emulator. You can even use it as a decompiler if you want! The two other interesting points for us are:</p>

<ol>
<li> Once we run a piece of code in the symbolic engine, we will <em>extract</em> certain computations / formulas. Thanks to Microsoft&rsquo;s <a href="https://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> we will be able to retrieve input values that will generate specific output values: this is basically what you gain by using a solver and symbolic variables.</li>
<li> But the other interesting point is that you still can use the extracted <a href="https://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> expressions as some kind of black-box <em>functions</em>. You know what the function is doing, kind of, but you don&rsquo;t know how ; and you are not interested in the how. You know the inputs, and the outputs. To obtain a concrete output value, you can just replace the symbolic variables by concrete values. This is really handy, especially when you are not only interested in finding input values to generate specific output values ; sometimes you just want to go both ways :&ndash;).</li>
</ol>


<p>Anyway, after this long theoretical speech let&rsquo;s have a look at some code. The first important job of the engine is to be able to parse MIPS assembly: fortunately for us this is really easy. We are directly feeding plain-text MIPS disassembly directly copied from IDA to our engine:</p>

<p>```python <a href="&#x6d;&#x61;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;&#58;&#109;&#105;&#x6e;&#105;&#95;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x70;&#x73;&#95;&#115;&#121;&#109;&#101;&#x78;&#101;&#99;&#x5f;&#x65;&#x6e;&#103;&#105;&#x6e;&#101;&#x2e;&#112;&#121;&#64;&#x4d;&#105;&#110;&#105;&#77;&#105;&#x70;&#x73;&#83;&#121;&#x6d;&#69;&#x78;&#101;&#x63;&#x45;&#110;&#103;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x65;&#x2e;&#x5f;&#x70;&#x61;&#114;&#115;&#x65;&#x5f;&#x6c;&#105;&#x6e;&#101;">&#x6d;&#105;&#x6e;&#x69;&#95;&#x6d;&#x69;&#x70;&#x73;&#x5f;&#115;&#121;&#109;&#101;&#120;&#101;&#99;&#95;&#x65;&#110;&#x67;&#x69;&#110;&#x65;&#46;&#112;&#x79;&#64;&#77;&#x69;&#x6e;&#x69;&#x4d;&#x69;&#112;&#115;&#83;&#121;&#x6d;&#69;&#120;&#101;&#99;&#69;&#x6e;&#x67;&#x69;&#110;&#x65;&#46;&#95;&#x70;&#x61;&#x72;&#x73;&#101;&#95;&#x6c;&#105;&#x6e;&#101;</a>
def _parse_line(self, line):
  addr_seg, instr, rest = line.split(None, 2)
  args = rest.split(&lsquo;,&rsquo;)
  for i in range(len(args)):</p>

<pre><code>if '#' in args[i]:
    args[i], _ = args[i].split(None, 1)
</code></pre>

<p>  a0, a1, a2 = map(</p>

<pre><code>lambda x: x.strip().replace('$', '') if x is not None else x,
args + [None]*(3 - len(args))
</code></pre>

<p>  )
  _, addr = addr_seg.split(&lsquo;:&rsquo;)
  return int(addr, 16), instr, a0, a1, a2
```</p>

<p>From here you have all the information you need: the instruction and its operands (<em>None</em> if an operand doesn&rsquo;t exist as you can have up to 3 operands). The other important job that follows is to handle the different type of operands ; here are the ones I encountered in the challenge:</p>

<ul>
<li>General purpose register,</li>
<li>Stack-variable,</li>
<li>Immediate value.</li>
</ul>


<p>To handle / convert those I created a bunch of dull / helper functions:</p>

<p>`&ldquo;python mini_mips_symexec_engine.py@MiniMipsSymExecEngine.<em>is</em>*
def _is_gpr(self, x):
  &rdquo;&lsquo;Is it a valid GPR name?&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  return x in self.gpr</p>

<p>def <em>is_imm(self, x):
  &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;Is it a valid immediate?&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  x = x.replace(&lsquo;loc</em>&rsquo;, &lsquo;0x&rsquo;)
  try:</p>

<pre><code>int(x, 0)
return True
</code></pre>

<p>  except:</p>

<pre><code>return False
</code></pre>

<p>def <em>to_imm(self, x):
  &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;Get an integer from a string immediate&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  if self.</em>is_imm(x):</p>

<pre><code>x = x.replace('loc_', '0x')
return int(x, 0)
</code></pre>

<p>  return None</p>

<p>def _is_memderef(self, x):
  &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;Is it a memory dereference?&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  return &lsquo;(&rsquo; in x and &lsquo;)&rsquo; in x</p>

<p>def is_stackvar(self, x):
  &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;Is is a stack variable?&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  return (&lsquo;(fp)&rsquo; in x and &lsquo;+&rsquo; in x) or (&lsquo;var_&rsquo; in x and &lsquo;+&rsquo; in x)</p>

<p>def to_stackvar(self, x):
  &lsquo;&rsquo;&lsquo;Get the stack variable name&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  _, var_name = x.split(&lsquo;+&rsquo;)
  return var_name.replace(&lsquo;(fp)&rsquo;, &lsquo;&rsquo;)
```</p>

<p>Finally, we have to handle every different instructions and their encodings. Of course, you need to implement only the instructions you want: most likely the ones that are used in the code you are interested int. In a nutshell, this is the core of the engine. You can also use it to output valid Python/C lines if you fancy having a decompiler in your sleeve ; might be handy right?</p>

<p>This is what the core function looks like, it is really simple, dumb and so unoptimized ; but at least it&rsquo;s clear to me:</p>

<p>`&ldquo;python mini_mips_symexec_engine.py@step
def step(self):
  &rdquo;&lsquo;This is the core of the engine &mdash; you are supposed to implement the semantics
  of all the instructions you want to emulate here.&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  line = self.code[self.pc]
  addr, instr, a0, a1, a2 = self._parse_line(line)
  if instr == &lsquo;sw&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>if self._is_gpr(a0) and self.is_stackvar(a1) and a2 is None:
  var_name = self.to_stackvar(a1)
  self.logger.info('%s = $%s', var_name, a0)

<p>  elif instr == &lsquo;lw&rsquo;:</p>

<pre><code>if self._is_gpr(a0) and self.is_stackvar(a1) and a2 is None:

</code></pre>

<p>[&hellip;]
```</p>

<p>The first level of <em>if</em> handles the different instructions, the second level of <em>if</em> handles the different encodings an instruction can have. The <em>self.logger</em> thingy is just my way to save the execution traces in files to let the console clean:</p>

<p>```python mini_mips_symexec_engine.py@<strong>init</strong>
def <strong>init</strong>(self, trace_name):
  self.gpr = {</p>

'v1' : 0,
</code></pre>

<h1>[&hellip;]</h1>

<pre><code>'lo' : 0,
'hi' : 0
</code></pre>

<p>  }</p>

<p>  self.stack = {}
  self.pc = 0
  self.code = []
  self.mem = {}
  self.stack_offsets = {}
  self.debug = False
  self.enable_z3 = False</p>

<p>  if os.path.exists(&lsquo;traces&rsquo;) == False:</p>

<pre><code>  os.mkdir('traces')
</code></pre>

<p>  self.logger = logging.getLogger(trace_name)
  h = logging.FileHandler(</p>

<pre><code>  os.path.join('traces', trace_name),
  mode = 'w'
</code></pre>

<p>  )</p>

<p>  h.setFormatter(</p>

<pre><code>  logging.Formatter(
      '%(levelname)s: %(asctime)s %(funcName)s @ l%(lineno)d -- %(message)s',
      datefmt = '%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
  )
</code></pre>

<p>  )</p>

<p>  self.logger.setLevel(logging.INFO)
  self.logger.addHandler(h)
```</p>

<p>At that point, if I wanted only an emulator I would be done. But because I want to use <a href="https://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> and symbolic variables I want to get your attention on two common pitfalls that can cost you hours of debugging (trust me on that one :&ndash;():</p>

<ul>
<li>The first one is that the operator <em>__rshift__</em> isn&rsquo;t the logical right shift but the arithmetical one; which is quite different and can generate results you don&rsquo;t expect:</li>
</ul>


<p>```python LShR VS >>
In [1]: from z3 import *</p>

<p>In [2]: simplify(BitVecVal(4, 3) >> 1)
Out[2]: 6</p>

<p>In [3]: simplify(LShR(BitVecVal(4, 3), 1))
Out[3]: 2</p>

<p>In [4]: 4 >> 1
Out[4]: 2
```
  To workaround that I usually define my own <em>_LShR</em> function that does whatever is correct according to the operand types (yes we could also replace <em>z3.BitVecNumRef.__rshift__</em> by <em>LShR</em> directly):</p>

<p>`&ldquo;python mini_mips_symexec_engine@<em>LShR
def </em>LShR(self, a, b):
  &rdquo;&lsquo;Useful hook function if you want to run the emulation
  with/without Z3 as LShR is different from >> in Z3&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  if self.enable_z3:</p>

<pre><code>if isinstance(a, long) or isinstance(a, int):
  a = BitVecVal(a, 32)
if isinstance(b, long) or isinstance(b, int):
  b = BitVecVal(b, 32)
return LShR(a, b)
</code></pre>

<p>  return a >> b
```</p>

<ul>
<li>The other interesting detail to keep in mind is that you can&rsquo;t have any overflow on <em>BitVec</em>s of the same size ; the result is automatically truncated. So if you happen to have mathematical operations that need to overflow, like a multiplication (this is used in the challenge), you should store the temporary result in a bigger temporary variable. In my case, I was supposed to store the overflow inside another register, <em>$hi</em> which is used to store the high <em>DWORD</em> part of the result. But because I wasn&rsquo;t storing the result in a bigger <em>BitVec</em>, <em>$hi</em> ended up <strong>always</strong> equal to zero which is quite a nice problem when you have to pinpoint this issue in thousands lines of assembly :&ndash;).</li>
</ul>


<p>```python mini_mips_symexec_engine@step@multu
elif instr == &lsquo;multu&rsquo;:
  if self.<em>is_gpr(a0) and self.</em>is_gpr(a1) and a2 is None:</p>

<pre><code>self.logger.info('$lo = ($%s * $%s) &amp; 0xffffffff', a0, a1)

  a0bis, a1bis = self.gpr[a0], self.gpr[a1]
  if isinstance(a0bis, int) or isinstance(a0bis, long):

<h2>Back into the battlefield</h2>

<p>Here comes the important bits!</p>

<h3>Extracting the function that generates the magic value from the son program counter</h3>

<p>All right, the main objective in this part is to extract the formula that generates the first magic value. As we said earlier, this big block can be seen as a function that takes two arguments (or symbolic variables) and generates the <em>magic DWORD</em> in output. The first thing to do is to copy the code somewhere to feed it to our engine ; I decided to stick all the codes I needed into a separate Python file called <em>code.py</em>.
<code>python code.py
block_generate_magic_from_pc_son = '''.text:00400B8C                 lw      $v0, 0x318+pc_son($fp)  # Load Word

Then we have to prepare the environment of our engine: the two symbolic variables are stack-variables, so we have to insert them in the context of our virtual environment. The resulting formula is going to be in <em>$v0</em> at the end of the execution ; this the holy grail, the formula we are after.</p>

<h3>Putting it all together: building a function that computes the new program counter of the son</h3>

<p>Obviously, we don&rsquo;t really care about those two previous functions, we just want to combine them together to implement the computation of the new program counter from both the round number &amp; where the son <em>SIGTRAP</em>&rsquo;d. The only missing bits is the lookup in the <em>QWORD</em>s array to extract the <em>second magic value</em>. We just have to dump the array inside another file called <em>memory.py</em>. This is done with a simple IDA Python one-liner:</p>

<p><code>python Dump the QWORD array with IDAPy
values = dict((0x00414130+i*8, Qword(0x00414130+i*8)) for i in range(0x25E))
</code></p>

<p>Now, we can build the whole function easily by combining all those pieces:</p>

<p>`&ldquo;python solve_nsc2014_step1_z3.py@generate_new_pc_from_pc_son_using_z3
def generate_new_pc_from_pc_son_using_z3(pc_son, n_break):
  &rdquo;&lsquo;Generate the new program counter from the address where the son SIGTRAP&rsquo;d and
  the number of SIGTRAP the son encountered&rsquo;&lsquo;&rsquo;
  loop_n = (n_break / 101)
  magic = generate_magic_from_son_pc_using_z3(pc_son, n_break)
  idx = None
  for i in range(len(memory.pcs)):</p>

<pre><code>if (memory.pcs[i] &amp; 0xffffffff) == magic:
  idx = i
  break
</code></pre>

<p>  assert(idx != None)
  return generate_new_pc_from_magic_high(memory.pcs[idx] >> 32, loop_n)
```</p>

<p>Sweet. Really sweet.</p>

<p>This basically means we are now able to <em>unscramble</em> the code of the son and reordering it completely without even physically running the binary nor generating traces.</p>

<h2>Unscramble the code like a sir</h2>

<p>Before showing, the code I just want to explain the process one more time:</p>

<ol>
<li> The son executes some code until it reaches a <em>break</em> instruction</li>
<li> The father gets the <em>$pc</em> of the son and the variable that counts the number of <em>break</em> instruction the son executed</li>
<li> The father generates a new <em>$pc</em> value from those two variables</li>
<li> The father sets the new <em>$pc</em></li>
<li> The father continues its son</li>
<li> Goto 1!</li>
</ol>


<p>So basically to unscramble the code, we just need to simulate what the father would do &amp; log everything somewhere. Couple of important details though:</p>

<ul>
<li>There are exactly 101 <em>break</em> instructions in the son, so 101 <em>chunks</em> of code will be executed and need to be <em>reordered</em>,</li>
<li>The son is executing 6 <em>rounds</em> ; that&rsquo;s exactly why the <em>QWORD</em> array has 6*101 entries.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the function I used:</p>

<p>```python solve_nsc2014_step1_z3.py@generate_son_code_reordered
def generate_son_code_reordered(debug = False):</p>

<pre><code>'''This functions puts in the right order the son's block of codes without
relying on the father to set a new $pc value when a break is executed in the son.
With this output we are good to go to create a nanomites-less binary:
  - We don't need the father anymore (he was driving the son)
  - We have the code in the right order, so we can also remove the break instructions
It will also be quite useful when we want to execute symbolic-ly its code.

                break
            i += 1

return cleaned_code
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>And there it is :&ndash;)</p>

<p>The function outputs the unrolled and ordered code of the son. If you want to push further, you could theoretically perform an open-heart surgery to completely remove the nanomites from the original binary, isn&rsquo;t it cool? This is left as an exercise for the interested reader though :&ndash;)).</p>

<h2>Attacking the son: the last man standing</h2>

<p>Now that we have the code unscrambled, we can directly feed it to our engine but before doing so here are some details:</p>

<ul>
<li>As we said earlier, it looks like the son is executing 6 times the same code. This is not the case <strong>at all</strong>, every round will execute the same amount of instructions but not in the same order</li>
<li>The computations executed can be seen as some kind of light encoding/encryption or decoding/decryption algorithm</li>
<li>We have 6 <em>rounds</em> because the input serial is broken into 6 <em>DWORD</em>s (so 6 symbolic variables) ; so basically each round is going to generate an output <em>DWORD</em></li>
</ul>


<p>As previously, we need to copy the code we want to execute. Note that we can also use <em>generate_son_code_reorganized</em> to generate it dynamically. Next step is to configure the virtual environment and we are good to finally run the code:</p>

<p>```python solve_nsc2014_step1_z3@get_serial first part
def get_serial():
  print &lsquo;> Instantiating the symbolic execution engine..&rsquo;
  x = mini_mips_symexec_engine.MiniMipsSymExecEngine(&lsquo;decrypt_serial.log&rsquo;)
  x.enable_z3 = True</p>

<p>  print &lsquo;> Generating dynamically the code of the son &amp; reorganizing/cleaning it..&rsquo;
  # If you don&rsquo;t want to generate it dynamically like a sir, I&rsquo;ve copied a version inside
  # code.block_code_of_son_reorganized_loop_unrolled :&ndash;)
  x.code = generate_son_code_reorganized()</p>

<p>  print &lsquo;> Configuring the virtual environement..&rsquo;
  x.gpr[&lsquo;fp&rsquo;] = 0x7fff6cb0
  x.stack_offsets[&lsquo;var_30&rsquo;] = 24
  start_addr = x.gpr[&lsquo;fp&rsquo;] + x.stack_offsets[&lsquo;var_30&rsquo;] + 8
  # (gdb) x/6dwx $s8+24+8
  # 0x7fff6cd0:     0x11111111      0x11111111      0x11111111
  #                 0x11111111      0x11111111      0x11111111
  a, b, c, d, e, f = BitVecs(&lsquo;a b c d e f&rsquo;, 32)
  x.mem[start_addr +  0] = a
  x.mem[start_addr +  4] = b
  x.mem[start_addr +  8] = c
  x.mem[start_addr + 12] = d
  x.mem[start_addr + 16] = e
  x.mem[start_addr + 20] = f</p>

<p>  print &lsquo;> Running the code..&rsquo;
  x.run()
```</p>

<p>The thing that matters this time is to find <em>a, b, c, d, e, f</em> so that they generate specific outputs ; so this is where <a href="https://z3.codeplex.com/">Z3</a> is going to help us a <strong>lot</strong>. Thanks to that guy we don&rsquo;t need to manually invert the algorithm.</p>

<p>The final bit now is basically just about setting up the solver, setting the correct constraints and generating the serial you guys have been waiting for so long:</p>

<p>```python solve_nsc2014_step1_z3@get_serial second part
  print &lsquo;> Instantiating &amp; configuring the solver..&rsquo;
  s = Solver()
  s.add(</p>

<pre><code>x.mem[start_addr +   0] == 0x7953205b, x.mem[start_addr +   4] == 0x6b63616e,
x.mem[start_addr +   8] == 0x20766974, x.mem[start_addr +  12] == 0x534e202b, 
x.mem[start_addr +  16] == 0x203d2043, x.mem[start_addr +  20] == 0x5d20333c,
</code></pre>

<p>  )</p>

<p>  print &lsquo;> Solving..&rsquo;
  if s.check() == sat:</p>

<pre><code>print '&gt; Constraints solvable, here are the 6 DWORDs:'
m = s.model()
for i in (a, b, c, d, e, f):
  print ' %r = 0x%.8X' % (i, m[i].as_long())

print '&gt; Serial:', ''.join(('%.8x' % m[i].as_long())[::-1] for i in (a, b, c, d, e, f)).upper()
</code></pre>

<p>  else:</p>

<pre><code>print '! Constraints unsolvable'
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>There we are, the final moment; <em>drum roll</em></p>

```</p>

<p>Boom :&ndash;).</p>

<h1>Alternative solution</h1>

<p>In this part, I present an alternate solution to solve the challenge. It&rsquo;s somehow a shortcut, since it requires much less coding than Axel&rsquo;s one, and uses the awesome <a href="https://code.google.com/p/miasm/">Miasm</a> framework.</p>

<h2>Shortcut #1 : Tracing the parent with GDB</h2>

<h3>Quick recap of the parent&rsquo;s behaviour</h3>

<p>As Axel has previously explained, the first step is to recover the child&rsquo;s execution flow. Because of <em>nanomites</em>, the child is driven by the parent; we have to analyze the parent (i.e. the <code>debug</code> function) first to determine the correct sequence of the child&rsquo;s <code>pc</code> values.</p>

<p>The parent&rsquo;s main loop is obfuscated, but by browsing cross-references of stack variables in IDA, we can see where each one is used. After a bit of analysis, we can try to decompile by hand the algorithm, and write a pseudo-Python code description of what the <code>debug</code> function does (it is really simplified):</p>

<p>```python debug_pseudo_code.py
counter = 0
waitpid()</p>

<p>while(True):</p>

<pre><code>regs = ptrace(GETREGS)

# big block 1
addr = regs.pc
param = f(counter)
addr = obfu1(addr, param)

for i in range(605):
    entry = pcs[i]  # entry is 8 bytes long (2 dwords)
    if(addr == entry.first_dword):
        addr = entry.second_dword
        break

# big block 2
addr = obfu2(addr, param)

regs.pc = addr
ptrace(SETREGS, regs)
counter += 1

if(not waitpid()):
    break
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The &ldquo;big blocks&rdquo; are the two long assembly blocks preceding and following the inner loop. Without looking at the gory details, we understand that a <code>param</code> value is derived from the counter using a function that I call <code>f</code>, and then used to obfuscate the original child&rsquo;s <code>pc</code>. The result is then searched in a <code>pcs</code> array (stored at address <code>0414130</code>), the next dword is extracted and used in a 2nd obfuscation pass to finally produce the new <code>pc</code> value injected into the child.</p>

<p>The most important fact here is that that this process does not involve the input key at anytime. <strong>The output <code>pc</code> sequence is deterministic and constant</strong>; two executions with two different keys will produce the same sequence of <code>pc</code>&rsquo;s. Since we know the first value of <code>pc</code> (the first <code>break</code> instruction at 040228C), we can theoretically compute the correct sequence and then reorder the child&rsquo;s instructions according to this sequence.</p>

<p>We have two approaches for doing so:</p>

<ul>
<li>statical analysis: somehow understand each instruction used in obfuscation passes and rewrite the algorithm producing the correct sequence. This is the <a href="#static_analysis_father">path followed by Axel</a>.</li>
<li>dynamic analysis: trace the program once and log all pc values.</li>
</ul>


<p>Although the first one is probably the most interesting, the second is certainly the fastest. Again, it only works because the input key does not influence the output <code>pc</code> sequence. And we&rsquo;re lucky: the child is already debugged by the parent, but nothing prevents us to debug the parent itself.</p>

<h3>First attempt at tracing</h3>

<p>Tracing is pretty straightforward with GDB using <code>bp</code> and <code>commands</code>. In order to understand the parent&rsquo;s algorithm a bit better, I first wrote a pretty verbose GDB script that prints the loop counter, <code>param</code> variable as well as the original and new child&rsquo;s <code>pc</code> for each iteration. I chose to put two breakpoints:</p>

<ul>
<li>The first one at the end of the first obfuscation blocks (0x401440)</li>
<li>The second one before the <code>ptrace</code> call at the end of the second block (0x0401D8C), in order to be able to read the child&rsquo;s <code>pc</code> manipulated by the parent.</li>
</ul>


<p>Here is the script:</p>

<p>```text gdb_trace1_script.txt</p>

<h6>#</h6>

<h1>A few handy functions</h1>

<h6>#</h6>

<p>def print_context_pc</p>

<pre><code>printf "regs.pc = 0x%08x\n", *(int*)($fp-0x1cc)

<p>def print_param</p>

<pre><code>printf "param = 0x%08x\n", *(int*)($fp-0x2f0)
</code></pre>

<p>def print_addr</p>

<pre><code>printf "addr = 0x%08x\n", *(int*)($fp-0x2fc)

<p>end</p>

<p>def print_counter</p>

<pre><code>printf "counter = %d\n", *(int*)($fp-0x300)
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<h6>#</h6>

<h1>break at the end of block 1</h1>

<p>b *0x401440
commands
silent
printf &ldquo;\nNew round\n&rdquo;
print_counter
print_context_pc
print_param
print_addr
c
end</p>

<h1>break before the end of block 2</h1>

<p>b *0x0401D8C
commands
silent
print_context_pc
c
end</p>

<p>c
```</p>

<p>To run that script within GDB, we first need to start <code>crackmips</code> with gdbserver in our <code>qemu</code> VM. After a few minutes, we get the following (cleaned) trace:</p>

<p>```text gdb_trace1.txt
New round
counter = 0
regs.pc = 0x0040228c
param = 0x00000000
addr = 0xcd0e9f0e
regs.pc = 0x00402290</p>

<p>New round
counter = 1
regs.pc = 0x004022bc
param = 0x00000000
addr = 0xcd0e99ae
regs.pc = 0x00402ce0</p>

<p>New round
counter = 2
regs.pc = 0x00402d0c
param = 0x00000000
addr = 0xcd0e420e
regs.pc = 0x00402da8</p>

<p>[&hellip;]
```</p>

<p>By reading the trace further, we realize that <code>param</code> is always equal to <code>counter/101</code>. This is actually the child&rsquo;s own loop counter, since its big loop is made of 101 pseudo basic blocks. We also notice that the <code>pc</code> sequence is different for each child&rsquo;s loop: round 0 is not equal to round 101, etc.</p>

<h3>Getting a clean trace</h3>

<p>Since we&rsquo;re only interested in the final <code>pc</code> value for each round, we can make a simpler script that just outputs those values. And organize them in a parsable format to be able to use them later in another script. Here is the version 2 of the script:</p>

<p>```text gdb_trace2_script.txt
def print_context_pc</p>

<pre><code>printf "0x%08x\n", *(int*)($fp-0x1cc)
</code></pre>

<p>end</p>

<p>set pagination off
set confirm off
file crackmips
target remote 127.0.0.1:4444</p>

<h1>break before the end of block 2</h1>

<p>b *0x0401D8C
commands
silent
print_context_pc
c
end</p>

<p>c
```</p>

<p>The cleaned trace only contains the 606 <code>pc</code> values, one on each line:</p>

<p><code>text gdb_trace.txt
0x00402290
0x00402ce0
0x00402da8
0x00403550
[...]
0x004030e4
0x004039dc
</code></p>

<p>Mission 1: accomplished!</p>

<h2>Shortcut #2 : Symbolic execution using Miasm</h2>

<p>We now have the list of each start address of each basic block executed by the child. The next step is to understand what each one of them does, and reorder them to reproduce the whole algorithm.</p>

<p>Even though <a href="#writing_symbolic_exec">writing a symbolic execution engine from scratch</a> is certainly a fun and interesting exercise, I chose to play with <a href="https://code.google.com/p/miasm/">Miasm</a>. This excellent framework can disassemble binaries in various architectures (among which x86, x64, ARM, MIPS, etc.), and convert them into an intermediate language called IR (<em>intermediate representation</em>). It is then able to perform symbolic execution on this IR in order to find what are the side effects of a basic block on registers and memory locations. Although there is not so much documentation, Miasm contains various <a href="https://code.google.com/p/miasm/source/browse/#hg%2Fexample">examples</a> that should make the API easier to dig in. Don&rsquo;t tell me that it is hard to install, it is really not (well, I haven&rsquo;t tried on Windows ;). And there is even a <a href="https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/miasm/base/">docker image</a>, so you have no excuse to not try it!</p>

<h3>Miasm symbolic execution 101</h3>

<p>Before scripting everything, let&rsquo;s first see how to use Miasm to perform symbolic execution of one basic block. For the sake of simplicity, let&rsquo;s work on the first basic block of the child&rsquo;s main loop.</p>

<p>```python miasm_example.py (1/5)
from miasm2.analysis.machine import Machine
from miasm2.analysis import binary</p>

<p>bi = binary.Container(&ldquo;crackmips&rdquo;)
machine = Machine(&lsquo;mips32l&rsquo;)
mn, dis_engine_cls, ira_cls = machine.mn, machine.dis_engine, machine.ira
```</p>

<p>First, we open the crackme using the generic <code>Container</code> class. It automatically detects the executable format and uses <em>Elfesteem</em> to parse it. Then we use the handy <code>Machine</code> class to get references to useful classes we&rsquo;ll use to disassemble and analyze the binary.</p>

<p>```python miasm_example.py (2/5)
BB_BEGIN = 0x00402290
BB_END = 0x004022BC</p>

<h1>Disassemble between BB_BEGIN and BB_END</h1>

<p>dis_engine = dis_engine_cls(bs=bi.bs)
dis_engine.dont_dis = [BB_END]
bloc = dis_engine.dis_bloc(BB_BEGIN)
print &lsquo;\n&rsquo;.join(map(str, bloc.lines))
```</p>

<p>Here, we disassemble a single basic block, by explicitly telling Miasm its start and end address. The disassembler is created by instantiating the <code>dis_engine_cls</code> class. <code>bi.bs</code> represents the binary stream we are working on. I admit the <code>dont_dis</code> syntax is a bit weird; it is used to tell Miasm to stop disassembling when it reaches a given address. We do it here because the next instruction is a <code>break</code>, and Miasm does not normally think it is the end of a basic block. When you run those lines, you should get this output:</p>

<p><code>text miasm_example.py output
LW         V1, 0x38(FP)
SLL        V0, V1, 0x2
ADDIU      A0, FP, 0x18
ADDU       V0, A0, V0
LW         A0, 0x8(V0)
LW         V0, 0x38(FP)
SUBU       A0, A0, V0
SLL        V0, V1, 0x2
ADDIU      V1, FP, 0x18
ADDU       V0, V1, V0
SW         A0, 0x8(V0)
</code></p>

<p>Okay, so we know how to disassemble a block with Miasm. Let&rsquo;s now see how to convert it into the Intermediate Representation:</p>

<p>```python miasm_example.py (3/5)</p>

<h1>Transform to IR</h1>

<p>ira = ira_cls()
irabloc = ira.add_bloc(bloc)[0]
print &lsquo;\n&rsquo;.join(map(lambda b: str(b[0]), irabloc.irs))
```</p>

<p>We instantiated the <code>ira_cls</code> class and called its <code>add_bloc</code> method. It takes a basic block as input and outputs a list of IR basic blocs; here we know that we&rsquo;ll get only one, so we use <code>[0]</code>. Let&rsquo;s see what is the output of those lines:</p>

<p><code>text miasm_sample.py output
V1 = @32[(FP+0x38)]
V0 = (V1 &lt;&lt; 0x2)
A0 = (FP+0x18)
V0 = (A0+V0)
A0 = @32[(V0+0x8)]
V0 = @32[(FP+0x38)]
A0 = (A0+(- V0))
V0 = (V1 &lt;&lt; 0x2)
V1 = (FP+0x18)
V0 = (V1+V0)
@32[(V0+0x8)] = A0
IRDst = loc_00000000004022BC:0x004022bc
</code></p>

<p>Each one of those lines are instructions in Miasm&rsquo;s IR language. It is pretty easy: each instruction is described as a list of side-effects it has on some variables, using expressions and affectations. <code>@32[...]</code> represents a 32-bit memory access; when it&rsquo;s on the left of an <code>=</code> sign, it&rsquo;s a <em>write</em> access, when it&rsquo;s on the right it&rsquo;s a <em>read</em>. The last line uses the pseudo-register <code>IRDst</code>, which is kind of the IR&rsquo;s <code>pc</code> register. It tells Miasm where is located the next basic block.</p>

<p>Great! Let&rsquo;s see now how to perform symbolic execution on this IR basic block.</p>

<p>```python miasm_example.py (4/5)
from miasm2.expression.expression import *
from miasm2.ir.symbexec import symbexec
from miasm2.expression.simplifications import expr_simp</p>

<h1>Prepare symbolic execution</h1>

<p>symbols_init = {}
for i, r in enumerate(mn.regs.all_regs_ids):</p>

<pre><code>symbols_init[r] = mn.regs.all_regs_ids_init[i]
</code></pre>

<h1>Perform symbolic exec</h1>

<p>sb = symbexec(ira, symbols_init)
sb.emulbloc(irabloc)</p>

<p>mem, exprs = sb.symbols.symbols_mem.items()[0]
print &ldquo;Memory changed at %s :&rdquo; % mem
print &ldquo;\tbefore:&rdquo;, exprs[0]
print &ldquo;\tafter:&rdquo;, exprs[1]
```</p>

<p>The first lines are initializing the symbol pool used for symbolic execution. We then use the <code>symbexec</code> module to create an execution engine, and we give it our fresh IR basic block. The result of the execution is readable by browsing the attributes of <code>sb.symbols</code>. Here I am mainly interested on the memory side-effects, so I use <code>symbols_mem.items()</code> to list them. <code>symbols_mem</code> is actually a dict whose keys are the memory locations that changed during execution, and values are pairs containing both the previous value that was in that memory cell, and the new one. There&rsquo;s only one change, and here it is:</p>

<p><code>text miasm_example.py output
Memory changed at (FP_init+(@32[(FP_init+0x38)] &lt;&lt; 0x2)+0x20) :
  before: @32[(FP_init+(@32[(FP_init+0x38)] &lt;&lt; 0x2)+0x20)]
  after: (@32[(FP_init+(@32[(FP_init+0x38)] &lt;&lt; 0x2)+0x20)]+(- @32[(FP_init+0x38)]))
</code></p>

<p>The expressions are getting a bit more complex, but still pretty readable. <code>FP_init</code> represents the value of the <code>fp</code> register at the beginning of execution. We can clearly see that a memory location as modified since a value was subtracted from it. But we can do better: we can give Miasm simplification rules in order to make this output much more readable. Let&rsquo;s do it!</p>

<p>```python miasm_example.py (5/5)</p>

<h1>Simplifications</h1>

<p>fp_init = ExprId(&lsquo;FP_init&rsquo;, 32)
zero_init = ExprId(&lsquo;ZERO_init&rsquo;, 32)
e_i_pattern = expr_simp(ExprMem(fp_init + ExprInt32(0x38), 32))
e_i = ExprId(&lsquo;i&rsquo;, 32)
e_pass_i_pattern = expr_simp(ExprMem(fp_init + (e_i &lt;&lt; ExprInt32(2)) + ExprInt32(0x20), 32))
e_pass_i = ExprId(&ldquo;pwd[i]&rdquo;, 32)</p>

<p>simplifications = {e_i_pattern      : e_i,</p>

<pre><code>               e_pass_i_pattern : e_pass_i,
               zero_init        : ExprInt32(0) }
</code></pre>

<p>def my_simplify(expr):</p>

<pre><code>expr2 = expr.replace_expr(simplifications)
return expr2
</code></pre>

<p>print &ldquo;%s = %s&rdquo; % (my_simplify(exprs[0]) ,my_simplify(exprs[1]))
```</p>

<p>Here we declare 3 replacement rules:</p>

<ul>
<li>Replace <code>@32[(FP_init+0x38)]</code> with <code>i</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>@32[(FP_init+(i &lt;&lt; 0x2)+0x20)]</code> with <code>pwd[i]</code></li>
<li>Replace <code>ZERO_init</code> with 0 (although it is not really useful here)</li>
</ul>


<p>There is actually a more generic way to do it using pattern matching rules with jokers, but we don&rsquo;t really need this machinery here. This the result we get after simplification:</p>

<p><code>text miasm_example.py final output
pwd[i] = (pwd[i]+(- i))
</code></p>

<p>That&rsquo;s all! So all this basic block does is a subtraction. What is nice is that the output is actually valid Python code :). This will be very useful in the last part.</p>

<h3>Generating the child&rsquo;s algorithm</h3>

<p>So in less than 60 lines, we were able to disassemble an arbitrary basic block, perform symbolic execution on it and get a pretty understandable result. We just need to apply this logic to the 100 remaining blocks, and we&rsquo;ll have a pythonic version of each one of them. Then, we simply reorder them using the GDB trace we got from the previous part, and we&rsquo;ll be able to generate 606 python lines describing the whole algorithm.</p>

<p>Here is an extract of the script automating all of this:</p>

<p>```python miasm_symbexec.py
def load_trace(filename):</p>

<pre><code>return [int(x.strip(), 16) for x in open(filename).readlines()]
</code></pre>

<p>def boundaries_from_trace(trace):</p>

<pre><code>bb_starts = sorted(set(trace))
boundaries = [(bb_starts[i], bb_starts[i+1]-4) for i in range(len(bb_starts)-1)]
boundaries.append((0x4039DC, 0x04039E8)) # last basic bloc, added by hand
return boundaries
</code></pre>

<p>def exprs2str(exprs):</p>

<pre><code>return ' = '.join(str(e) for e in exprs)
</code></pre>

<p>trace = load_trace(&ldquo;gdb_trace.txt&rdquo;)
boundaries = boundaries_from_trace(trace)</p>

<p>print &ldquo;# Building IR blocs &amp; expressions for all basic blocks&rdquo;
bb_exprs = []
for zone in boundaries:</p>

<pre><code>bb_exprs.append(analyse_bb(*zone))
</code></pre>

<p>print &ldquo;# Reconstructing the whole algorithm based on GDB trace&rdquo;
bb_starts = [x[0] for x in boundaries]
for bb_ea in trace:</p>

<pre><code>bb_index = bb_starts.index(bb_ea)
#print "%x : %s" % (bb_ea, exprs2str(bb_exprs[bb_index]))
print exprs2str(bb_exprs[bb_index])
</code></pre>

<p>```</p>

<p>The <code>analyse_bb()</code> function perform symbolic execution on a single basic block, given its start and end addresses. This is just wrapping what we&rsquo;ve been doing so far into a function. The GDB trace is opened, parsed, and a list of basic block addresses is built from it (we cheat a little bit for the last one of the loop, by hardcoding it). Each basic block is analyzed and the resulting expressions are pushed into the <code>bb_exprs</code> list. Then the GDB trace is processed, by outputting the expressions corresponding to each basic block.</p>

<p>This is what we get:</p>

<p>```python output_algo.py</p>

<h1>Building IR blocs &amp; expressions for all basic blocks</h1>

<h1>Reconstructing the whole algorithm based on GDB trace</h1>

<p>pwd[i] = (pwd[i]+(&ndash; i))
pwd[i] = ((0x0|pwd[i])<sup>0xFFFFFFFF</sup>)
pwd[i] = (pwd[i]^i)
pwd[i] = (pwd[i]^i)
pwd[i] = (pwd[i]+0x3ECA6F23)
pwd[i] = (pwd[i]+0x6EDC032)
[&hellip;]
pwd[i] = ((pwd[i] &lt;&lt; 0x14)|(pwd[i] >> 0xC))
pwd[i] = ((pwd[i] &lt;&lt; ((i+0x1)&amp;0x1F))|(pwd[i] >> ((((0x0|i)<sup>0xFFFFFFFF</sup>)+0x20)&amp;0x1F)))
i = (i+0x1)
```</p>

<h2>Solving with Z3</h2>

<p>Okay, so now we have a Python (and even C ;) file describing the operations performed on the 6 dwords containing the input key. We could try to bruteforce it, but using a constraint solver is much more elegant and faster. I also chose Z3 because it has nice Python bindings. And since its expression syntax is mostly compatible with Python, we just need to add a few things to our generated file!</p>

<p>```python sample_solver.py
from z3 import *
import struct</p>

<p>solution_str = &ldquo;[ Synacktiv + NSC = &lt;3 ]&rdquo;
solutions = struct.unpack(&ldquo;&lt;LLLLLL&rdquo;, solution_str)
N = len(solutions)</p>

<h1>Hook Z3&rsquo;s <code>&gt;&gt;</code> so it works with our algorithm</h1>

<h1>(logical shift instead of arithmetic one)</h1>

<p>BitVecRef.<strong>rshift</strong>  = LShR</p>

<p>pwd = [BitVec(&ldquo;pwd_%d&rdquo; % i, 32) for i in range(N)]
pwd_orig = [pwd[i] for i in range(N)]
i = 0</p>

<h1>paste here all the generated algorithm from previous part</h1>

<h1>BEGIN ALGO</h1>

<p>pwd[i] = (pwd[i]+(&ndash; i))
pwd[i] = ((0x0|pwd[i])<sup>0xFFFFFFFF</sup>)</p>

<h1>[&hellip;]</h1>

<p>pwd[i] = ((pwd[i] &lt;&lt; ((i+0x1)&amp;0x1F))|(pwd[i] >> ((((0x0|i)<sup>0xFFFFFFFF</sup>)+0x20)&amp;0x1F)))
i = (i+0x1)</p>

<h1>END ALGO</h1>

<p>s = Solver()</p>

<p>for i in range(N):</p>

<pre><code>s.add(pwd[i] == solutions[i])
</code></pre>

<p>assert s.check() == sat</p>

<p>m = s.model()
sol_dw = [m[pwd_orig[i]].as_long() for i in range(N)]
key = &lsquo;&rsquo;.join((&ldquo;%08x&rdquo; % dw)[::-1].upper() for dw in sol_dw)</p>

<p>print &ldquo;KEY = %s&rdquo; % key
```</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve declared the valid solution, the list of 6 32-bit variables (<code>pwd</code>), pasted the algorithm, and ran the solver. We just need to be careful with the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> operation, since Z3 <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/25535854">treats</a> it as an arithmetic shift, and we want a logical one. So we replace it with a dirty hook.</p>

<p>The solution should come almost instantly:</p>

<p><code>bash
$ python sample_solver.py
KEY = 322644EF941077AB1115AB575363AE87F58E6D9AFE5C62CC
</code></p>

<h2>Alternative solution &ndash; conclusion</h2>

<p>I chose this solution not only to get acquainted with Miasm, but also because it required much less effort and pain :). It fits into approximately 20 lines of GDB script, and 120 of python using Miasm and Z3. You can find all of those in this <a href="https://github.com/egirault/NoSuchCon2014/tree/master/">folder</a>.
I hope it gave you an understandable example of symbolic execution and what you can do with it. However I strongly encourage you to dig into Miasm&rsquo;s code and examples if you want to really understand what&rsquo;s going on under the hood.</p>
