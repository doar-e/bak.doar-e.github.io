# Introduction
The purpose of this little post is to create a piece of code able to monitor exceptions raised in a process (a bit like [gynvael](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/)'s [ExcpHook](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/?id=148) but in userland), and to generate a report with information related to the exception. The other purpose is to have a look at the internals of course.

```

That's why I divided this post in two big parts:

 * the first one will talk about Windows internals background required to understand how things work under the hood,
 * the last one will talk about [*Detours*](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/detours/) and how to hook *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher* toward our purpose. Basically, the library gives programmers a set of APIs to easily hook procedures. It also has a clean and readable documentation, so you should use it! It is usually used for that kind of things:
   * Hot-patching bugs (no need to reboot),
   * Tracing API calls ([API Monitor](http://www.rohitab.com/apimonitor) like),
   * Monitoring (a bit like our example),
   * Pseudo-sandboxing (prevent API calls),
   * etc.

# Lights on *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher*
The purpose of this part is to be sure to understand how exceptions are given back to userland in order to be handled (or not) by the [SEH](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms680657(v=vs.85\).aspx)/[UEF](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms681401(v=vs.85\).aspx) mechanisms ; though I'm going to focus on Windows 7 x86 because that's the OS I run in my VM. The other objective of this part is to give you the big picture, I mean we are not going into too many details, just enough to write a working exception sentinel PoC later.


## nt!KiTrap*
When your userland application does something wrong an exception is raised by your CPU: let's say you are trying to do a division by zero (*nt!KiTrap00* will handle that case), or you are trying to fetch a memory page that doesn't exist (*nt!KiTrap0E*).

I'm sure you already know that but in x86 Intel processors there is a table called the [IDT](http://wiki.osdev.org/Interrupt_Descriptor_Table) that stores the different routines that will handle the exceptions. The virtual address of that table is stored in a special x86 register called *IDTR*, and that register is accessible only by using the instructions *sidt* (Stores Interrupt Descriptor Table register) and *lidt* (Loads Interrupt Descriptor Table register).

Basically there are two important things in an IDT entry: the address of the [ISR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interrupt_handler), and the segment selector (remember it's a simple index in the [GDT](http://wiki.osdev.org/GDT_Tutorial)) the CPU should use.

```

The entry just above tells us that for the processor 0, if a *division-by-zero* exception is raised the kernel mode routine nt!KiTrap00 will be called with a flat-model code32 ring0 segment (cf GDT dump).

Once the CPU is in *nt!KiTrap00*'s code it basically does a lot of things, same thing for all the other *nt!KiTrap* routines, but somehow they (more or less) end up in the kernel mode exceptions dispatcher: *nt!KiDispatchException* (remember [gynvael](http://gynvael.coldwind.pl/)'s tool ? He was hooking that method!) once they created the *nt!_KTRAP_FRAME* structure associated with the fault. 

{% img center /images/ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher/butterfly.png nt!KiExceptionDispatch graph from ReactOS %}

Now, you may already have asked yourself how the kernel reaches back to the userland in order to process the exception via the SEH mechanism for example ?

That's kind of simple actually. The trick used by the Windows kernel is to check where the exception took place: if it's from user mode, the kernel mode exceptions dispatcher sets the field *eip* of the trap frame structure (passed in argument) to the symbol *nt!KeUserExceptionDispatcher*. Then, *nt!KeEloiHelper* will use that same trap frame to resume the execution (in our case on *nt!KeUserExceptionDispatcher*).

But guess what ? That symbol holds the address of *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher*, so it makes total sense!
```text

```

If like me you like illustrations, I've made a WinDbg session where I am going to show what we just talked about. First, let's trigger our *division-by-zero* exception:

```text
kd> bp nt!KiTrap00
kd> g

divzero+0x1269:

```

Now let's go a bit further in the ISR, and more precisely when the *nt!_KTRAP_FRAME* is built:

The idea now is to track the modification of the *nt!_KTRAP_FRAME.Eip* field as we discussed earlier (BTW, don't try to put directly a breakpoint on *nt!KiDispatchException* with VMware, it just blows my guest virtual machine) via a hardware-breakpoint:

```text
kd> ba w4 esp+68
kd> g
Breakpoint 2 hit
nt!KiDispatchException+0x3d6:
846c559e c745fcfeffffff  mov     dword ptr [ebp-4],0FFFFFFFEh
kd> dt nt!_KTRAP_FRAME Eip @esi
   +0x068 Eip : 0x77b36448
kd> ln 0x77b36448
Exact matches:
    ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher (<no parameter info>)
```

OK, so here we can clearly see the trap frame has been modified (keep in mind WinDbg gives you the control *after* the actual writing). That basically means that when the kernel will resume the execution via *nt!KiExceptionExit* (or *nt!Kei386EoiHelper*, two symbols for one same address) the CPU will directly execute the user mode exceptions dispatcher.

Great, I think we have now enough understanding to move on the second part of the article.

# Serial Detourer
In this part we are going to talk about Detours, what looks like the API and how you can use it to build a userland exceptions sentinel without too many lines of codes. Here is the list of the features we want:

 * To hook *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher*: we will use Detours for that,
 * To generate a tiny readable exception report: for the disassembly part we will use [Distorm](http://www.ragestorm.net/distorm/) (yet another easy cool library to use),
 * To focus x86 architecture: because unfortunately the express version doesn't work for x86_64.

Detours is going to modify the first bytes of the API you want to hook in order to redirect its execution in your piece of code: it's called an *inline-hook*.

{% img center /images/ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher/detours.png %}

Detours can work in two modes:

 * A first mode where you don't touch to the binary you're going to hook, you will need a DLL module you will inject into your binary's memory. Then, Detours will modify in-memory the code of the APIs you will hook. That's what we are going to use.
 * A second mode where you modify the binary file itself, more precisely the [IAT](http://sandsprite.com/CodeStuff/Understanding_imports.html). In that mode, you won't need to have a DLL injecter. If you are interested in details about those tricks they described them in the *Detours.chm* file in the installation directory, read it!

So our sentinel will be divided in two main parts:

 * A program that will start the target binary and inject our DLL module (that's where all the important things are),
 * The sentinel DLL module that will hook the userland exceptions dispatcher and write the exception report.

The first one is really easy to implement using [DetourCreateProcessWithDll](https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/blob/master/The%20Sentinel/ProcessSpawner/main.cpp#L66): it's going to create the process and inject the DLL we want.

```text
Usage: ./ProcessSpawner <full path dll> <path executable> <excutable name> [args..]
```

To successfully hook a function you have to know its address of course, and you have to implement the hook function. Then, you have to call *DetourTransactionBegin*, *DetourUpdateThread*, *DetourTransactionCommit* and you're done, wonderful isn't it ?

The only tricky thing, in our case, is that we want to hook *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher*, and that function has its own custom calling convention. Fortunately for us, in the *samples* directory of Detours you can find how you are supposed to deal with that specific case:

```c KiUserExceptionDispatcher hook
VOID __declspec(naked) NTAPI KiUserExceptionDispatcher(PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord, PCONTEXT Context)
{
    /* Taken from the Excep's detours sample */
    __asm
    {
        xor     eax, eax                ; // Create fake return address on stack.
        push    eax                     ; // (Generally, we are called by the kernel.)

        push    ebp                     ; // Prolog
        mov     ebp, esp                ;
        sub     esp, __LOCAL_SIZE       ;
    }

    EnterCriticalSection(&critical_section);
    log_exception(ExceptionRecord, Context);
    LeaveCriticalSection(&critical_section);

    __asm
    {
        mov     ebx, ExceptionRecord    ;
        mov     ecx, Context            ;
        push    ecx                     ;
        push    ebx                     ;
        mov     eax, [TrueKiUserExceptionDispatcher];
        jmp     eax                     ;
        //
        // The above code should never return.
        //
        int     3                       ; // Break!
        mov     esp, ebp                ; // Epilog
        pop     ebp                     ;
        ret                             ;
    }
}
```

Here is what looks *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher* like in memory after the hook:

{% img center /images/ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher/hook.png %}

Disassembling some instructions pointed by the *CONTEXT.Eip* field is also really straightforward to do with *distorm_decode*:

```c Use distorm3 to disassemble some codes
if(IsBadReadPtr((const void*)Context->Eip, SIZE_BIGGEST_X86_INSTR * MAX_INSTRUCTIONS) == 0)
{
  _DecodeResult res;
  _OffsetType offset = Context->Eip;
  _DecodedInst decodedInstructions[MAX_INSTRUCTIONS] = {0};
  unsigned int decodedInstructionsCount = 0;

  res = distorm_decode(
      offset,
      (const unsigned char*)Context->Eip,
      MAX_INSTRUCTIONS * SIZE_BIGGEST_X86_INSTR,
      Decode32Bits,
      decodedInstructions,
      MAX_INSTRUCTIONS,
      &decodedInstructionsCount
  );

  if(res == DECRES_SUCCESS || res == DECRES_MEMORYERR)
  {
    fprintf(f, "\nDisassembly:\n");
    for(unsigned int i = 0; i < decodedInstructionsCount; ++i)
    {
      fprintf(
        f,
        "%.8I64x (%.2d) %-24s %s%s%s\n",
        decodedInstructions[i].offset,
        decodedInstructions[i].size,
        (char*)decodedInstructions[i].instructionHex.p,
        (char*)decodedInstructions[i].mnemonic.p,
        decodedInstructions[i].operands.length != 0 ? " " : "",
        (char*)decodedInstructions[i].operands.p
      );
    }
  }
}
```

So the prototype works pretty great like that.

```

But once I've encountered a behavior that I didn't plan on: there was like a stack-corruption in a stack-frame protected by the */GS* cookie. If the cookie has been, somehow, rewritten the program calls *___report_gs_failure* (sometimes the implementation is directly inlined, thus you can find the definition of the function in your binary) in order to kill the program because the stack-frame is broken. Long story short, I was also hooking *kernel32!UnhandleExceptionFilter* to not miss that kind of exceptions, but I noticed while writing this post that it doesn't work anymore. We are going to see why in the next part.

# The untold story: Win8 and *nt!KiFastFailDispatch*
## Introduction
When I was writing this little post I did also some tests on my personal machine: a Windows 8 host. But the test for the */GS* thing we just talked about wasn't working at all as I said. So I started my investigation by looking at the code of *__report_gsfailure* (generated with a VS2012) and I saw this:

```c __report_gsfailure
void __usercall __report_gsfailure(unsigned int a1<ebx>, unsigned int a2<edi>, unsigned int a3<esi>, char a4)
{
  unsigned int v4; // eax@1
  unsigned int v5; // edx@1
  unsigned int v6; // ecx@1
  unsigned int v11; // [sp-4h] [bp-328h]@1
  unsigned int v12; // [sp+324h] [bp+0h]@0
  void *v13; // [sp+328h] [bp+4h]@3

  v4 = IsProcessorFeaturePresent(0x17u);
  // [...]
  if ( v4 )
  {
    v6 = 2;
    __asm { int     29h             ; DOS 2+ internal - FAST PUTCHAR }
  }
  [...]
  __raise_securityfailure(&GS_ExceptionPointers);
}
```

The first thing I asked myself was about that weird *int 29h*. Next thing I did was to download a fresh Windows 8 VM [here](http://www.modern.ie/fr-fr/virtualization-tools#downloads) and attached a kernel debugger in order to check the IDT entry 0x29:

```text

As opposed I was used to see on my Win7 machine:

Dumping IDT: 80b95400

29: 00000000
```

I've opened my favorite IDE and I wrote a bit of code to test if there was a different behavior between Win7 and Win8 regarding this exception handling:

```c gs.c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <windows.h>

int main()
{
  __try
  {
    __asm int 0x29
  }
  __except(EXCEPTION_EXECUTE_HANDLER)
  {
    printf("SEH catched the exception!\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

On Win7 I'm able to catch the exception via a SEH handler: it means the Windows kernel calls the user mode exception dispatcher for further processing by the user exception handlers (as we saw at the beginning of the post). But on Win8, at my surprise, I don't get the message ; the process is killed directly after displaying the usual message box "a program has stopped". Definitely weird.

## What happens on Win7
When the interruption 0x29 is triggered by my code, the CPU is going to check if there is an IDT entry for that interruption, and if there isn't it's going to raise a #GP (*nt!KiTrap0d*) that will end up in *nt!KiDispatchException*.

And as previously, the function is going to check where the fault happened and because it happened in userland it will modify the trap frame structure to reach *ntdll!KiUserExceptionDispatcher*. That's why we can catch it in our *__except* scope.

## What happens on Win8
This time the kernel has defined an ISR for the interruption 0x29: *nt!KiRaiseSecurityCheckFailure*. This function is going to call *nt!KiFastFailDispatch*, and this one is going to call *nt!KiDispatchException*:

{% img center /images/ntdll.KiUserExceptionDispatcher/kifastfaildispatch.png %}

BUT the exception is going to be processed as a **second-chance** exception because of the way *nt!KiFastFailDispatch* calls the kernel mode exception dispatcher. And if we look at the source of *nt!KiDispatchException* in ReactOS we can see that this exception won't have the chance to reach back the userland as in Win7 :)):

```c KiDispatchException from ReactOS
VOID
NTAPI
KiDispatchException(IN PEXCEPTION_RECORD ExceptionRecord,
                    IN PKEXCEPTION_FRAME ExceptionFrame,
                    IN PKTRAP_FRAME TrapFrame,
                    IN KPROCESSOR_MODE PreviousMode,
                    IN BOOLEAN FirstChance)
{
    CONTEXT Context;
    EXCEPTION_RECORD LocalExceptRecord;

// [...]
    /* Handle kernel-mode first, it's simpler */
    if (PreviousMode == KernelMode)
    {
// [...]
    }
    else
    {
        /* User mode exception, was it first-chance? */
        if (FirstChance)
        {
// [...]
// that's in this branch the kernel reaches back to the user mode exception dispatcher
// but if FirstChance=0, we won't have that chance

          /* Set EIP to the User-mode Dispatcher */
          TrapFrame->Eip = (ULONG)KeUserExceptionDispatcher;

          /* Dispatch exception to user-mode */
          _SEH2_YIELD(return);
        }

        /* Try second chance */
        if (DbgkForwardException(ExceptionRecord, TRUE, TRUE))
        {
            /* Handled, get out */
            return;
        }
        else if (DbgkForwardException(ExceptionRecord, FALSE, TRUE))
        {
            /* Handled, get out */
            return;
        }
// [...]
    return;
}
```

To convince yourself you can even modify the *FirstChance* argument passed to *nt!KiDispatchException* from *nt!KiFastFailDispatch*. You will see the SEH handler is called like in Win7:

Cool, we have now our answer to the weird behavior! I guess if you want to monitor */GS* exception you are going to find another trick :)).

# Conclusion
I hope you enjoyed this little trip in the Windows' exception world both in user and kernel mode. You will find the seems-to-be-working PoC on my github account here: [The sentinel](https://github.com/0vercl0k/stuffz/tree/master/The%20Sentinel). By the way, you are highly encouraged to improve it, or to modify it in order to suit your use-case!
