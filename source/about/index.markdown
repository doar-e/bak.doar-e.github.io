If you like code obfuscation, breaking protection schemes, weird machines, anti-debugging tricks, packers, bug-exploitation or anything about binaries, get in touch with us if you are willing to get involved somehow! As a writer, a correcter, ideas-giver, ..anything!

See that blog as a micro-blogging platform where you can speak about binaries-related subjects. We don't want to use it to write long papers, because a lot of us have already their personnal blogs ; use it for stuff you don't publish on your blogs.

You can also contact the owners:

  - Axel Souchet: [twitter][1], [github][2]
  - Jonathan Salwan: [twitter][3], [github][4]
  - Jérémy Fetiveau: [twitter][5], [github][6]

We are also hanging out on IRC ([#doar-e@irc.w3challs.com](irc://#doar-e@irc.w3challs.com)) and on twitter ([@doar_e](https://twitter.com/doar_e)).
